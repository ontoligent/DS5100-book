The course provides an introduction to programming from a data science perspective. It focuses on the development of basic skills in Python and R Programming, as well the command line and GitHub. It is currently one of two foundational courses taught, along with a course in linear models.",

    "text": "The main objective of the course is to introduce fundamental programming concepts and techniques so that students may successfully complete courses in data science, including machine learning and data analysis, as well as to become successful data scientists in the workplace.\nIn addition to Python and R, topics covered range from using the command line, git, and GitHub, to visualization and project management.\nThe course is designed to instill a basic competency on which to build out one’s knowledge and skills within the program. It is not exhaustive, but instead strives to teach you just enough to get you going with confidence to learn as you go.\nThis is not a course in programming from a computer science perspective. It is designed to give you enough familiarity with writing code that you will be able to acquire deeper knowledge of programming — and the computational machinery that undergirds it — in your development as a data scientist. Consequently, many. of the discussions of what is going on “under they hood,” such as how data are stored in memory, are glossed over.",

Below are some brief descriptions of the tools.\nFile Explorer. A web-based GUI to access the file system of the remote server. Can be used to create, move, and delete directories and files, and to edit the contents of files (see Editor). You can also upload and download files through this interface. The File Explorer is useful to view your remote content and manage files and directories without having to use the command line. Note that not all operations can be performed through this interface.\nFind under “Files” in the menu. \nEditor. A web-based text editor launched from the File Explorer to view and edit text files on the remote server.  Although not as sophisticated as VS Code (below), this is very useful for editing data and code files without having to use a command line editor. One advantage over VS Code is that it does not need to be launched – which means it does not time out like the Interactive Apps listed below.\nThe Editor is launched from the File Explorer.\nSSH Shell Access (Terminal). Access to the command line of the remote server.  Use this to open a terminal window to perform Linux commands directly.  Note that It is necessary to use a terminal to install and run certain programs on the remote server.\nFind under “Clusters” in the menu. \nYou can also access the remote command line via SSH on your local computer. Just enter the following on the command line of either a PC or Mac:\nssh -Y &lt;userid&gt;@rivanna.hpc.virginia.edu\nReplace &lt;userid&gt; with your UVA Net ID, e.g. abc2x. \nBe suer to be running VPN if you are accessing Rivanna from an off-grounds location.",

Be sure to give yourself enough time when launching these, and to be aware of how much time you have when working.\nNote also that you should allocate the fewest resources necessary to do the work you plan to do. This saves resources on the remote host, but also allows your app to launch more quickly. If you ask for an excessive amount of resources, you may wait a long time (e.g. hours) to have your app launched.\nDesktop. Access to a GUI desktop to the remote server. This provides a access to various applications on the server, including a web browser, a file explorer, and terminal windows.  Using this is not necessary if you can get by with the tools listed above.\nFind under “Interactive Apps &gt; Desktop” in the menu.\nVS Code. Access to Visual Studio Code on the remote server.

They also, typically provide GUIs but we won’t go into those here.\nThe Unix family includes all varieties of Linux and the Mac OS (which is based on FreeBSD).\nThe command line that you actually interact with – the set of commands available to you – is called a shell, and there are several shells that you can run on your system. The most typical shell in use today is called bash which stands for Bourne Again Shell, since it is an improved version of bsh (The Bourne Shell). New versions of MacOS use the Z shell (zsh). The commands in these two shells are mostly similar, but there are subtle differences.\nWindows has shells too for its command line interface. The default shell is DOS, but is also has PowerShell  as an advanced (and very capable) option.\nFor more information, check out these resources:",

The book itself is also a great introduction to data science!\n\nOne last thing – for fun you may want to read Neal Stephenson’s “In the Beginning Was The Command Line”, a kind of cyberpunk history of the topic.

    "text": "Steps\n\nPart A\nOn your local machine\n\nGet to the command line on the computer from which you will be pushing and pulling to your GitHub repo.\n\n\nIf you are using Rivanna, you can access this through the Dashboard or connect via SSH.\nIf you are using a Mac, open Terminal.\nIf you are using Windows and you have admin rights, first install git-bash. Otherwise follow this tutorial from Microsoft.\n\n\nMove into your root directory. If on a Unix-based system (Rivanna or a Mac), you can do this by entering cd by itself.\nGenerate the key:\n\n\nEnter: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email_id@example.com\", using your email address.\nThe value ed25519 is the key type and must not be changed.\nBe sure to use the email address associated with your GitHub account in the above command.\n\n\nAt the prompt, type in a secure passphrase.\n\n\nYou don’t have to do this, but it is advised.\nCreate a memorable sentence.\nA good passphrase should have at least 15, preferably 20 characters and be difficult to guess.

    "text": "Using Git and GitHub Together\nIn practice, although Git does not require GitHub, we tend to use Git and GitHub together.\nWe use Git to perform version control on our code, and we use GitHub to share code and to collaborate on coding projects.\nWhen we use Git and GitHub together, we typically follow patterns.\nFor example, a basic series of actions one continually makes with Git are the following:\n\n\n\nAction\nDescription\nCommand\n\n\n\n\nFork\nForking a repo makes a copy of someone else’s repo in your GitHub account, which you can now modify. Note: Forking does not have to be performed if you are not interested in altering the code. You can clone it directly.\nThis is done through GitHub’s web interface by clicking on the Fork button.\n\n\nClone\nCloning the repo to a workspace to which you have access, whether a local machine or a remote resource (e.g. Rivanna).\ngit clone &lt;repo&gt;\n\n\nAdd\nCreating or editing a file locally and then adding it to the list of files git will keep track of.\ngit add &lt;filename&gt;Note that you may use wildcards here, e.g. *, to add more than one file at a time.\n\n\nCommit\nCommitting the changes made to the file by adding them to the repo’s database of changes. This is accompanied by a brief, descriptive message of the changes made.\ngit commit -m \"What you did\"\n\n\nPush\nPushing the changes to the remote repo that you cloned from. This uploads both the files and the database changes to the repo.\ngit push\n\n\nPull\nPulling, i.e. downloading, any changes that have been made to the remote repo to your local repo. This usually happens if you are working in teams on the same project.\ngit pull\n\n\nPull Request\nThis is a request made to the owner of the original repo to pull in the changes you’ve made to your forked copy.\nThis is done through GitHub’s web interface. Read the docs. \n\n\nFetch Upstream\nThis refreshes the content of your forked repo with the content from the original repo.\nThis is done through GitHub’s web interface. Read the docs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is not the only pattern to use with Git. Here is another — the Git Fork-Branch-Pull Workflow\n\n\nHere is a visualization of the process:\n\n\n\nDiagram of common git workflow\n\n\nIn this diagram, the dashed lines refer to actions performed only once for a given repo.\nForking and cloning are done once to acquire a repo.\nFetch upstream (aka sync fork) and pull requests take place on the GitHub server.\nPull and push on your local machine are done repeatedly as you develop and share code.\nNote that the here the expression “remote workstation” may be confusing; it means remote relative to your laptop, e.g. Rivanna, which we sometimes call local relative to the GitHub repo.\nIn any case, note that these two copies of the same repo do not communicate with each other directly, but rather through their common relationship with the GitHub hosted instance of the repo.",

I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his [sic] code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.\n\nWhich sounds a lot like Eric Raymond’s “Rule of Representation” from 2003:\n\nFold knowledge into data, so program logic can be stupid and robust.\n\nWhich was just his summary of ideas like this one from Rob Pike in 1989:\n\nData dominates. If you’ve chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.\n\nWhich cites Fred Brooks from 1975:\n\nRepresentation is the Essence of Programming\n\nBeyond craftsmanship lies invention, and it is here that lean, spare, fast programs are born. Almost always these are the result of strategic breakthrough rather than tactical cleverness. Sometimes the strategic breakthrough will be a new algorithm, such as the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform or the substitution of an n log n sort for an n 2 set of comparisons.\n\n\nMuch more often, strategic breakthrough will come from redoing the representation of the data or tables. This is where the heart of your program lies. Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall be continued to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won’t usually need your flowcharts; they’ll be obvious.",

    "text": "Behavior Differences\nRelatedly, mutable and immutable objects behave differently in the context of variable assignment.\nFor example, when you assign a variable to another variable of a mutable datatype, any changes to the data are reflected by both variables.\nThe new variable is just an alias for the old variable.\nThis is only true for mutable datatypes.\nLets explore how + operator behaves differently between mutables and immutables.\nFirst, let’s create a function that will allow us to compare the objects as we modify them.\n\ndef compare_objects(trial:int, obj1:str, obj2:str):\n    o1 = eval(obj1)\n    o2 = eval(obj2)\n    print(f\"t{trial} {obj1} {o1} {id(o1)}\")\n    print(f\"t{trial} {obj2} {o2} {id(o2)}\")\n    print(f\"{obj1} == {obj2}:\", o1 == o2)\n\nList t1\nWe initialize a list and make a copy of it.\nNote that the two variables share the same id.\n\na0 = [1,2,3,4,5]\na1 = a0 # Make a copy of a list\ncompare_objects(1, 'a0', 'a1')\n\nt1 a0 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 139842806146944\nt1 a1 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 139842806146944\na0 == a1: True\n\n\nList t2\nNow we add to the copy and note the effects on the original.\nThe original value is also changed.\nThis is because both variables point to the same object.\n\na1 += [12] # Extend the copy\ncompare_objects(2, 'a0', 'a1')\n\nt2 a0 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12] 139842806146944\nt2 a1 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12] 139842806146944\na0 == a1: True\n\n\nList t3\nNote, however, that if we don’t use the unary operator,\nthen a1 becomes a different object!\nLutz goes into the difference between the += and the + in Ch 11 pages 360-363.\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\n\na1 = a1 + [12] # Extend the copy\ncompare_objects(3, 'a0', 'a1')\n\nt3 a0 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12] 139842806146944\nt3 a1 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 12] 139842804350592\na0 == a1: False\n\n\nList t4\nTry it with a new object copy, to avoid any possible inference between t2 and t3.\n\na2 = a0\na2 = a2 + [12] # Extend the copy\ncompare_objects(4, 'a0', 'a2')\n\nt4 a0 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12] 139842806146944\nt4 a2 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 12] 139842804515456\na0 == a2: False\n\n\nWe get the same result.\nTuple t1\nLet’s try this with a tuple.\nWe see again that both variables have the same id.\n\nb0 = (1,2,3,4,5)\nb1 = b0 # Make a copy of a tuple\ncompare_objects(1, 'b0', 'b1')\n\nt1 b0 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) 139842804681360\nt1 b1 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) 139842804681360\nb0 == b1: True\n\n\nTuple t2\nHowever, if extend the tuple with the unary operator, b1 becomes a new object.\nNote how this differs from the list behavior.\n\nb1 += (12,) # Extend the copy\ncompare_objects(2, 'b0', 'b1')\n\nt2 b0 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) 139842804681360\nt2 b1 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12) 139842804315424\nb0 == b1: False\n\n\nTuple t3\nIf we don’t use the unary operator, the same thing happens again.\nThe value of b1 becomes a new object because the variable has been reassigned.\n\nb1 = b1 + (12,) # Extend the copy\ncompare_objects(3, 'b0', 'b1')\n\nt3 b0 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) 139842804681360\nt3 b1 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 12) 139842804316096\nb0 == b1: False\n\n\nLet’s look at another example.\nHere is a list:\n\nfoo = ['hi']\nbar = foo\ncompare_objects(1, 'foo', 'bar')\n\nt1 foo ['hi'] 139842804665216\nt1 bar ['hi'] 139842804665216\nfoo == bar: True\n\n\n\nbar += ['bye']\ncompare_objects(2, 'foo', 'bar')\n\nt2 foo ['hi', 'bye'] 139842804665216\nt2 bar ['hi', 'bye'] 139842804665216\nfoo == bar: True\n\n\n\nbar = bar + ['bye']\ncompare_objects(2, 'foo', 'bar')\n\nt2 foo ['hi', 'bye'] 139842804665216\nt2 bar ['hi', 'bye', 'bye'] 139842805379520\nfoo == bar: False\n\n\nAnd here is a tuple:\n\nfoo1 = ('hi')\nbar1 = foo1\ncompare_objects(1, 'foo1', 'bar1')\n\nt1 foo1 hi 139843849783920\nt1 bar1 hi 139843849783920\nfoo1 == bar1: True\n\n\n\nbar1 += ('bye')\ncompare_objects(2, 'foo1', 'bar1')\n\nt2 foo1 hi 139843849783920\nt2 bar1 hibye 139842806205616\nfoo1 == bar1: False",

END IF.\nFor example, here is how this control structure might look in other languages:\n\nif (val &lt;= 0) {\n    print(val);\n} \nelse {\n    print(-val);\n}\nOr:\nIF val &lt;= 0\n    PRINT val\nELSE\n    PRINT -val\nEND IF\nPython uses tabs — spaces, actually — to signify logical blocks off code.\nIt is therefore imperative to understand and get a feel for indentation.\n\n\n\nelif\nelif is reached when the previous statements are not.\nNote that if one succeeds, those that follow are not processed.\nThis is unlike a series of if statements.\n\nval = -2\n\nif -10 &lt; val &lt; -5:\n    print('bucket 1')\nelif -5 &lt;= val &lt; -2:\n    print('bucket 2')\nelif val == -2:\n    print('bucket 3')\n\nbucket 3\n\n\n\n\nelse\nelse can be used as a catch-all for situation when no condition is met.\n\nval = 5\n\nif -10 &lt; val &lt; -5:\n    print('bucket 1')\nelif -5 &lt;= val &lt; -2:\n    print('bucket 2')\nelif val == -2:\n    print('bucket 3')\nelse:\n    print('bucket 4')\n\nbucket 4\n\n\nIt’s a good practice to include an else statement.\n\n\nif and else as one-liners\nPython provides a short-hand way of defining if statements.\n\nx = 3\n\nprint('odd') if x % 2 == 1 else print('even')\n\nodd\n\n\nThe general form:\nACTION1 if CONDITION else ACTION2\nBoth if and else are required. This breaks:\n\nprint('odd') if x % 2 == 1\n\nSyntaxError: expected 'else' after 'if' expression (471325368.py, line 1)\n\n\nEssentially, then, this is an either/or construct.\n\n\nUsing multiple conditions\nIf statements can be complex combinations of expressions. Use parentheses to keep order of operations correct.\nCorrect:\n\nprint(1) if (-2 &lt; val &lt; 2) or (val &gt; 10) else print(2)\n\n2\n\n\nIncorrect:\n\nprint(1) if (-2 &lt; val) &lt; 2 or val &gt; 10 else print(2)\n\n1\n\n\nThe problem is that the condition line is interpreted as True &lt; 2, where True is cast to integer value \\(1\\).",

Using the term ‘list’ broadly, we may say that Lists imply loops.\nThere are two main kinds of loops in Python: while and for.\n\nwhile loops\nWhile loops iterate while some condition is true.

Sequences are designed so that elements come out of them in the same order they were put in.\nSets and dictionaries are not sequences per se, since they the order of their elements is not as important as their names. They are called collections.\nNote that prior to Python 3.7, the order of elements in sets and dictionaries was arbitrary. Now, dictionaries preserve the order in which they were populated, and sets are sorted.",

    "text": "Lutz on Scoping\nHere’s an excerpt from Lutz, Chapter 17. Please read the whole thing.\nThe enclosing module is a global scope. Each module is a global scope—that is, a namespace in which variables created (assigned) at the top level of the module file live. Global variables become attributes of a module object to the outside world after imports but can also be used as simple variables within the module file itself.\nThe global scope spans a single file only. Don’t be fooled by the word “global” here—names at the top level of a file are global to code within that single file only. There is really no notion of a single, all-encompassing global file-based scope in Python. Instead, names are partitioned into modules, and you must always import a module explicitly if you want to be able to use the names its file defines. When you hear “global” in Python, think “module.”\nAssigned names are local unless declared global or nonlocal. By default, all the names assigned inside a function definition are put in the local scope (the namespace associated with the function call). If you need to assign a name that lives at the top level of the module enclosing the function, you can do so by declaring it in a global statement inside the function. If you need to assign a name that lives in an enclosing def, as of Python 3.X you can do so by declaring it in a nonlocal statement.\nAll other names are enclosing function locals, globals, or built-ins. Names not assigned a value in the function definition are assumed to be enclosing scope locals, defined in a physically surrounding def statement; globals that live in the enclosing module’s namespace; or built-ins in the predefined built-ins module Python provides.\nEach call to a function creates a new local scope. Every time you call a function, you create a new local scope—that is, a namespace in which the names created inside that function will usually live. You can think of each def statement (and lambda expression) as defining a new local scope, but the local scope actually corresponds to a function call. Because Python allows functions to call themselves to loop—an advanced technique known as recursion and noted briefly in Chapter 9 when we explored comparisons—each active call receives its own copy of the function’s local variables. Recursion is useful in functions we write as well, to process structures whose shapes can’t be predicted ahead of time; we’ll explore it more fully in Chapter 19.\nThere are actually other scope levels.\nHere is a nice visualization of them:\n\n\n\nScope Levels\n\n\nPlease read Lutz, Chapter 17 for a good overview of scoping.",

    "text": "Open Files with open()\nPython’s open() function allows you to read and write files from the file system, or, as we sometimes say, “from disk.”\nA common use case is opening up a text file containing data you want to work with, such as a CSV file.\nCSV means “Comma Separated Values.”\nA CSV file is a plain text file where each line has a list of data items separated (i.e. delimitied) by a comma (or other character, such as tab).\nEach row should have the same number of delimited items.\nOften, but not always, the first line contains the names of the columns for the delimited data.",

    "text": "Biostats Data\nLet’s open a sample CSV file, biostats.csv.\nBecause we want to convert it into a Python data structure, we need to know something about how the source file is structured. Here are some basic facts about the file:\n\nIt has some biometric statistics for a group of office workers.\nThere are 18 records, recording Name, Sex, Age, Height, Weight\nThere is an initial header line.\n\nThis file was downloaded from https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html and modified slightly.\nLet’s open a downloaded version.\n\nsrc_file_name = \"./sample_data_files/biostats.csv\"\nfile_handle = open(src_file_name, 'r')\n\nThe open() function takes two parameters:\n\nThe name of the file we want to open.\nThe mode in which the file is opened. It defaults to r which means open for reading in text mode. Other common values are:\n\nw for writing (truncating the file if it already exists)\nx for creating and writing to a new file\na for appending\n\n\nThis returns a file an iterator.\nWe sometimes call the file object a file “handle.”\nTo get the contents of the file into the program, we have a couple of options.\n.read() reads in the file as one long string.\n.readlines() reads in the file as a list of lines, created by the hard returns \\n in the source file.\nLet’s look at the first function:\n\nfile_as_big_string = file_handle.read()\n\n\nfile_as_big_string[:1000]\n\n'\"Name\",

These provide a high-level interface for tabular data analysis and are better optimized for that use. For instance, the C-struct-like memory layout of structured arrays in numpy can lead to poor cache behavior in comparison.\nNumPy documentation",

They have their own scope, data, and logic. Ideally, they can be deployed in any context and be shielded from external states.\n\nObjects are meant to be black boxes to users: they should only be interacted with via the methods and attributes provided.\nNothing else should influence the state of the object except what it contains and what is passed to it.\n\nInheritance means that classes can be subclasses of other classes and thereby inherit their ancestor attributes and methods. - Some programming languages allow only single inheritance – classes can have one parent. - Python supports multiple inheritance, but this can be complicated to use.\nPolymorphism means that methods can perform different behaviors based on the arguments they are passed. - That is, a function can be defined more than once in a class, as long as it each has a unique signature. - A signature is the particular pattern of arguments (parameters) a method has.\nToday, we are only going to focus on encapsulation …\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a movement to implement only this concept.\nMicrosoft, for example, developed a component-based approach to programming, where components are encapsulated unites of code without the complexity of inheritance.",

    "text": "Programming for Data Science\nGGPlot is the graphics package associated with the Tidyverse.\nIn this notebook, we will present a quick overview of the design principles behind the package.\nAs with Dplyr, GGPlot2 is a an entirely new system that supplants the older graph functions that are built into R.\nIt is founded on a principled analysis of its domain and from this develops a basic grammar which can then be expressed in R.\nJust as Dplyr is built on a grammar of data consisting of pipable verbs that correspond to the logic data transformation, GGPlot2 is built on a grammar of graphics consisting of nouns that correspond to the architecture of a graphic (aka plot).\nThe phrase “grammar of graphics” actually comes from the book by that name written by statistician and computer scientist Leland Wilkinson in 1999 and later revised:\n\nIt is worth reading if you want to get a solid grounding in visualization, which belongs to the design area of data science.\nThe Grammar of Graphics takes an object-oriented approach to visualization and formalizes two main principles:\n\nGraphics are built out of distinct layers.\nIn each layer, meaningful plots are constructed through mappings of data onto aesthetics.\n\nThe primary layers are these:\n\nAccording to Wickham, who adopted these principles and applied them to R,\n\nA grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic. Such a grammar allows us to move beyond named graphics (e.g., the “scatterplot”) and gain insight into the deep structure that underlies statistical graphics (Wickham 2012).\n\nWickham takes this idea and develops it into this:\n\nSource (see also ScienceCraft).\nIn this model, everything starts with data.\nThen data are mapped on aesthetics within geometries.\n\nGeometries are geometric things like points, lines, and bars.\nAesthetics are visual things like position, size, color and shape.\n\nAlso note that aesthetics make use of visual channels to signify features and their properties.\n\nSize can mean greater than, which is good for numeric scale but not categories\nColor can signify things like value, e.g. via red : dangerous : : green : safe.\n\nThese compose the primary layers.\nThe other layers apply downstream modifications that add more information and style to the graph.",

    "text": "Programming for Data Science\nIn this notebook, we look at GGPlot2, the specific graphics package associated with the Tidyverse.\nIt implements the logic of the grammar of graphics model described in the previous notebook.\n\nA First Plot\nEverything starts with getting ggplot(), which is imported when you import tidyverse.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.4     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr

the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nGGPlot gives lots of warning messages.\nFor sake of clarity, we are going to turn these off for now.\nWe’re also going to the set the default size of our plots so they display better.\nWe do this with the options() function we saw earlier.\n\noptions(warn=-1)\noptions(repr.plot.width = 16, repr.plot.height = 10)\n\nHere is a basic graph — a scatterplot comparing two features in the iris dataset.\nThe functions and arguments are broken out so you can see how the grammar is implemented:\n\niris %&gt;%\n    ggplot(\n        mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)\n    ) + \n    geom_point(\n        size = 5, \n        aes(color = Species)\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is an alternate way to build the graph:\n\niris %&gt;%\n    ggplot() +\n    aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width) + \n    geom_point(size = 5) +\n    aes(color = Species)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote how we can pull the aes() functions out of the geom_ and mapping() functions.\nNote that to create a scatterplot, we did not use a function like geom_scatterplot().\nInstead, we constructed one from scratch using the buildings blocks according to a simple design pattern.\nWe will see that some plot types are constructred this way while others have named functions.\nFor example, a histogram is created with geom_hist().\n\n\nHow it Works\nThe ggplot() function starts by creating a coordinate system that you can add layers to.\nYou can think of it as providing a base layer or canvas.\nOther layers are added by calling geometry functions.\nFor example, geom_point creates a point-based visualization.\nFor each layer, we can apply an aesthetic mapping.\nHere’s a description of what we just plotted:\ngglot() + # Build the coordinate system, i.e. the base layer canvas\n\naes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width) + # Map two features onto the `x` and `y` axes\n\ngeom_point(size = 3) + # Define a geometry that gives visible form to `x` and `y` coordinates\n\naes(color = Species) # Map colors onto coordinates by a third dimension\nNote that the coordinate system can be changed after the graph is initiated.\nThere are many geom_ functions:\n\ngeom_point()\ngeom_bar()\ngeom_histogram()\ngeom_boxplot()\ngeom_violin()\ngeom_density()\n\netc.\nThese can be layered on top of each other in a variety of ways.\nThere are also many channels that can used to represent numeric and categorical features with aes():\n\nx and y positions (in a two-dimensional system)\nColor\nSize\nShape\nText\n\n\n\nA Two Layered Plot\nHere we have a plot with two layers.\nThe second layer is created by a stat_ function.\nThis function internally applies a geom_ function to a statistical transformation to the data.\n\niris %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) + \n    geom_point(size = 5, aes(color = Species)) + \n    stat_smooth(method = lm)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tilde sign ~ means “as a function of” — in this case, y is being plotted as function of x.\nInterestingly, if we pull the aes() function out of geom_point(), we get a different plot.\n\niris %&gt;%\n    ggplot() +\n    aes(color=Species) +\n    geom_point(size = 5) +\n    aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width) +\n    stat_smooth(method = lm)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe + Operator\nYou will notice the use of the + operator to connect GGPlot functions together to produce a final product.\nTheses are not quite the same as pipes %&gt;%.\nWhereas pipes feed data from one function to another, the + operation is a form of method chaining.\nWe saw method chaining in Pandas.\nKeep in mind: the + always goes at the end of a line, never at the beginning.\n\n\nFaceting\nGGPlot also provides plot faceting.\nFaceting is the visual equivalent of grouping in the split-apply-combine pattern.\nJust as with grouping, the distinct values in a data feature are used to divide the visualization into groups.\nEach group takes the same form but shows a different subset of data.\n\niris %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) + \n    geom_point(size = 5, aes(color = Species)) + \n    stat_smooth(method = lm) +\n    facet_wrap(facets = vars(Species))\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the way, this is an example of Simpson’s Paradox.\nThe overall trend is downward, but each group trend upward.\nWe can see this by layering the regression line for the aggregate over the individual ones.\n\niris %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) + \n    geom_point(size = 5, aes(color=Species)) + \n    stat_smooth(method = lm, se=F) +\n    stat_smooth(method = lm, se=F, aes(color=Species))\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote, the se argument in stat_smooth() toggles whether or not to display the shaded confidence intervals.\n\n\nVisualizing Dimensions\nAesthetics and facets are ways to represent extra dimensions without resorting to increasing the number of axes in our plots.\nFor example, instead of using color or facets to represent species, we might have considered a third axis z to represent this feature.\nWe tend to avoid going beyond two axes in our plots and so resort to other visual devices.\n\n\nBar Chart\nLet’s look at some other geometries.\nHere is a simple bar chart made with gemo_bar().\n\nmtcars %&gt;% \n    ggplot(aes(x = cyl)) +\n    geom_bar(fill = 'limegreen')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram\nThe function geom_hist() will generate a histogram.\nNote that this function actually performs a behind-the-scenes data transformation, which goes beyond mapping the data.\nWe typically see this with the stat_ family of functions.\n\nmtcars %&gt;% \n    ggplot(aes(x = mpg)) + \n    geom_histogram(bins = 20, aes(fill = factor(cyl))) + \n    labs(title=\"Histogram\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the use of the lab() function to provide a title.\n\n\nDensity Plot\nHere is a kernel density estimate (KDE) plot made with geom_density().\nA KDE plot is a smoothed version of a histogram.\nAs with geom_histogram(), this function does some behind-the-scenes compuation and then plots the result.\n\nmtcars %&gt;% \n    ggplot(aes(x = mpg)) + \n    geom_density(size = 2, aes(fill = factor(cyl))) + \n    labs(title=\"Density plot\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplot\nThe function geom_boxplot() gives a classic boxplot, showing the mean, quantiles, and outliers of each variable.\nNote the arguments used — they control how the outliers are rendered.\nNotice we also pull out the aes() function for clarity; it could have remained within the geometry function’s argument space.\n\nmtcars %&gt;% \n    ggplot(aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg)) +\n    geom_boxplot(\n        width = 0.5, \n        outlier.colour = \"dodgerblue\", \n        outlier.size = 4, \n        outlier.shape = 16, \n        outlier.stroke = 2, \n    ) + \n    aes(fill = factor(cyl)) +\n    labs(title = \"Box plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolin Plot\nThis is a violin plot using geom_violin().\nA violin plot is something like a smoothed version of a boxplot.\nThis version is untrimmed, i.e. we set trim to FALSE.\n\nmtcars %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(factor(cyl), mpg)) + \n    geom_violin(width = 0.5, trim = F) + \n    aes(fill = factor(cyl)) +\n    labs(title = \"Violin plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeatmap\nTo create a heatmap, we use geom_tile().\nTo use this function, we first need to reshape our data into narrow form.\nHere, we take a correlation matrix among the features of mtcars.\n\ncorr &lt;- round(cor(mtcars), 2)\ncorr\n\n\n\nA matrix: 11 × 11

we can pass the narrow data frame to our plot constructor:\n\nnarrow %&gt;% ggplot() +\n    aes(x = Var1, y = Var2, fill = value, label = value) +\n    geom_tile() + \n    geom_text(color = \"white\", size = 8) + \n    labs(title=\"mtcars - Correlation plot\") + \n    theme(text=element_text(size = 20), legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the use of theme() function to remove the legend and alter the font size in the result.\n\n\nAssigning to a Variable\nWe can assign plots to variables and build them incrementally.\n\ngg &lt;- iris %&gt;% ggplot()\ngg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngg &lt;- gg + aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)\ngg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngg &lt;- gg + geom_point(size=5)\ngg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngg &lt;- gg + aes(color = Species)\ngg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngg &lt;- gg + stat_smooth(method = 'lm')\ngg\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign Pattern\nLet’s use this ability to assign plots to variables to demonstrate another design pattern.\nOften, you will have data of a certain kind and you want to visualize it various ways.\nYou may not be sure of the most effective visualization, so you want to play around.\nFor example, you may want to explore the relationship between two continuous variables.\nThis relationship can visualized using a variety of geometries.\nSo, we may begin by assigning the basic plot to a variable and then applying different geometries to it.\n\nmy_gg &lt;- ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy))\nmy_gg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe object my_gg just contains a blank canvas with two labeled and scaled axes.\nHere we draw a simple scatter plot by adding a geometry to our object.\n\nmy_gg + geom_point(size=5, color='red')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we show the coordinates as text labels showing cty with a rectangle background.\nThe object remains unchanged by the previous visualization; we are just swapping out geometries.\n\nmy_gg + geom_label(aes(label = cty), nudge_x = 1, nudge_y = 1, color = 'blue') \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a simple regression line.\n\nmy_gg + geom_smooth(method = lm) \n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here is a boxplot …\n\nmy_gg + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe geom_density2d() function shows a \\(2\\)D kernel density estimation overlaying a scatterplot.\n\nmy_gg + geom_point() + geom_density2d()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here is filled line graph.\n\nmy_gg + geom_area(fill='red')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis notebook just scratches the surface of what you can do with GGPlot.\nThere are many other features we have not covered, such as changing coordinates.\nIn addition, there are many more geometry and statistics layers we have not shown.\nHowever, hopefully you understanding something of the logic of GGPlot and have gained insight into how graphics are built.\nThis should enable you to make informed guesses and asked effective questions as you develop your knowledge of this powerful toolkit.",

    "text": "Programming for Data Science\n\nLiterate Programming\nR provides a notebook style coding environment similar to Jupyter called R Markdown.\nIt follows the literate programming paradigm of inter-leaving text and runnable code.\nAs with Jupyter, they can be used interactively or as exported documents into standard formats.\nR Markdown files consists of the three types of element:\n\nMetadata, written in YAML (at the top of the file).\nText, written in Markdown.\nCode, written in one of several supported programming languages.\n\nAll of these are plain text and live in the same .Rmd file.\n\n\nMarkdown\nAs the name implies, R Markdown files uses a version of Markdown to create the text components and define the code blocks.\nMardown is a simplified version of HTML markup that uses typographic symbols and line spaces instead of angle brackets.\nFor example, instead of writing this in HTML:\n\nThis is is header\n\n\nThis paragraph defines a link/\n\nYou would write this:\n\n\nThis is a header\nThis paragraph defines a link.\nThe markdown gets converted into HTML by a viewer or converter at display time.\n\n\nCode\nThe code blocks are delimmited by three backtacks ``` with a language specified in braces.\nFor example, to run a block of R code, you would enter this:\nx &lt;- 10\nprint(x)\nR Markdown also supports running code in other languages in the same document.\nTo run a Python block, you could do something like this:\nx = 10\nprint(x)\nIn RStudio, these blocks of code can be executed in place, with results output in below the cell, as with Jupyter.\n\n\nComparison to Jupyter\nR Markdown files are optimized to be published documents.\nJupyter notebooks are meant primarily to be interactive environments.\nR Markdown files are plain text.\nJupyter notebooks are written in JavaScript.\nJavaScript is the native programming language of web browsers; the notebook format is executable code that can be integrated into a web application.\n\n\nVarieties of R Markdown outputs\nR Markdown is designed to be output to several formats, including notebooks, documents, presentations, and interactive applications.\nNotebooks and documents can be output as HTML, PDF, or Word files.\nPresentations may be output in IOSlides, Beamer, or PowerPoint format.\nInteractive applications are interactive apps that can be published on the web with a framework called Shiny.\n\n\nKnitting\nKnitting is the process of compiling all the code and visual assets of an R Markdown into a single file.\n\n\nPublishing\nRMarkdown has publication in mind as an outcome. RStudio allows you to publish in these destinations:\n\nRPubs\nR Studio Connect\n\n\n\nOutputting\nThere are two ways to set the output of a document:\n\nPermanently, by modifying the YAML header:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Viridis Demo\"\noutput: html_document\n---\n\nTransiently, by calling rmarkdown::render() by hand:\n\nrmarkdown::render(“diamond-sizes.Rmd”, output_format = “word_document”)\nThis is useful if you want to programmatically produce multiple types of output.\nRStudio’s knit button renders a file to the first format listed in its output field.\n\n\nOutput options\nTo override the default parameter values, you need to use an expanded output field. For example, if you wanted to render an html_document with a floating table of contents, you’d use:\n---\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    toc: true\n    toc_float: true\n---\nYou can even render to multiple outputs by supplying a list of formats:\n---\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    toc: true\n    toc_float: true\n  pdf_document: default\n---\nNote the special syntax if you don’t want to override any of the default options.\n\n\nHow It Works",

    "text": "Programming for Data Science\nRelated to GGPlot are two other visualization libraries that are worth looking into.\nPlotly is a cross platform visualization library that is great for making interactive plots.\nAnd GGPlotly provides a convenient way to translate GGPlot plots into Ploty plots.\nLet quickly take a look at these.\nFirst, lets install the Tidyverse and turn off warnings.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.4     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\n\noptions(warn = -1) # Turn off warnings\n\n\nPlotly in R\nPlotly runs on R, Python, JavaScript, and Matlab.\nIt uses the same model in each language, so learning it in R can help you use it in these other languages.\nWe first install it and then import it.\n\n# install.packages(\"plotly\")\n\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n\nAttaching package: ‘plotly’\n\n\nThe following object is masked from ‘package:ggplot2’:\n\n    last_plot\n\n\nThe following object is masked from ‘package:stats’:\n\n    filter\n\n\nThe following object is masked from ‘package:graphics’:\n\n    layout\n\n\n\n\nHere is a list of the kinds of plots you can create in Plotly:\nTypes of plots\n'bar', 'barpolar', 'box', 'candlestick', 'carpet', 'choropleth', 'choroplethmapbox', 'cone', 'contour', 'contourcarpet', 'densitymapbox', 'funnel', 'funnelarea', 'heatmap', 'heatmapgl', 'histogram', 'histogram2d', 'histogram2dcontour', 'icicle', 'image', 'indicator', 'isosurface', 'mesh3d', 'ohlc', 'parcats', 'parcoords', 'pie', 'pointcloud', 'sankey', 'scatter', 'scatter3d', 'scattercarpet', 'scattergeo', 'scattergl', 'scattermapbox', 'scatterpolar', 'scatterpolargl', 'scatterternary', 'splom', 'streamtube', 'sunburst', 'surface', 'table', 'treemap', 'violin', 'volume', 'waterfall'\nLet’s create a scatter plot.\nNote how we just specify the type and set the relevant arguments.

    "text": "Programming for Data Science\n\nWhat is Project Management?\nBroadly speaking, project management (PM) is a class of rational methods and protocols for organizing the labor of complex activities in order to achieve specific outcomes that are on time and on budget.\nPM is important for data science programming because programming means building software, and software projects often invovle teams building complicated products for clients.\nPM is an established field that is used for many activities, from military operations to business processes.\nIt is a profession in which you can be certified as a CPM.\nIt is a field of study with an established and large body of knowledge known as PMBOK.\nThe history of PM dates to the early 20th century when scientific techniques were applied to management and manufacturing.\nOne of the earliest tools of project management is the Gantt Chart, a tool to visualize the relationship between many labor and production components.\n\nSource\nPM becomes highly developed in the 1950s and ’60s in the post-war era.\nThink of the complexity of the Manhattan Project or NASA’s moon shot.\nFrom the beginning, PM has been used to support critical operations: weapons systems, air traffic control, financial systems, health care, etc.\nIncreasingly, software became involved in all of the operations.\nBut in the 1960s, the US Department of Defense’s study of software problems found that:\n\\(47\\%\\) of software delivered could not be used, as it usually didn’t meet requirements.\n\\(29\\%\\) of funded software was never delivered, as it was usually canceled due to cost/schedule overruns.\n\\(19\\%\\) of software was useful after extensive rework, and it usually cost \\(36\\) times more to fix problems after release.\nEventually, PM was adapted to software development, to address these issues.\nSoftware development is hard for many reasons:\nHardware and software are inherently complex.\nCode is imperfect and error-prone.\nCode is always an interpretation of specifications that are always underspecified.\nCode is underspecified in two senses:\nFirst, there is the inherent inadequacy of language to represent reality.\n“The map is not the terrain”\nSecond is the fact that people don’t know what they want even when they say they do.\nThat is, reality itself changes.\nThe slipperiness of writing code that achieves our goals is captured in the Danish proverb:\n\nThe operation was a success, but the patient died.\n\n\n\nParadigms of Software Development\nTo address these issues, many paradigms of the software development life cycle (SDLC) have been introduced over the years.\nTwo popular approaches are the Waterfall and Spiral methods.\n\n\nThe Waterfall Model\nThe Waterfall model represents softwawre development as a linear process that begins with requirements gathering and formalization and ends with maintaining software products.\nThe metaphor is that everythings descends from the requirements.\n\n\n\nWaterfall Methodology\n\n\nSource\n\n\nThe Iron Triangle\nOne of the limitations of the waterfall model is that it relies heavily on getting the requirements right in the first place.\nThe Iron Triangle concept shows the effect of changing user requirements on a project.\nIf users want to add something to a project — a new feature, for example — this means that scope has increased.\nTherefore, either time or resources must expand as well to allow for the change.\n\n\n\npm-iron-triangle.png\n\n\n\n\nThe Spiral Model\nThe Spiral method addresses the problem of changing requirements by being more iterative.\nIt introduces the client at points in an ongoing cycle.\n\nSource\nBoth methods have the virtue of being rational and comprehensive, defining all the things involved in software development.\nBut they are very linear.\nEven the Spiral method is a linear process. The same linear sequence —\nObjective Identification \n-&gt; Alternate Evaluation \n-&gt; Product Development\n-&gt; Next Phase Planning \n— is repeated successively until the project is completed.\n\n\nEngineering and Human Labor\nWhat these methods have in common is a faith in the power of planning and engineering to achieve results.\nPlanning assumes the ability to predict accurately how things will unfold and that people understand and follow rules.\nHowever, life is not always linear.\nMany factors interfere to alter the movement from requirements to product.\n\n\nClient and Developer\nThese relationship between initial requirements and final product are embodied in the relationship between client and developer.\nBut notice the absence of the client in the design, building, and validation phases in both models.\nThis is partly the result of mitigating the mission creep introduced by the client, which runs afoul of the iron triangle.\nBut effective software design often requires a more involved role for the client.",

    "text": "Programming for Data Science\n\nEnter Agile\nAgainst the linearity of previous PM approaches, agile software development is an approach that embraces non-linearity and client participation.\nHistorically, agile PM appeared in the early 2000s and was spurred by the affordances of the Web and open source software.\nThe success of Linux and other open source projects showed that software development need not follow the rigid bureaucratic conventions of the military or corporation.\nInstead, software development teams could organize organically, without oversight, using tools like Git.\nThey could also release their products iteratively, getting both user and developer feedback quickly.\n\n\nThe Agile Way\nAgile development is essentially a philosophy developed in response to bureaucratic software development processes.\nIt is an approach that focuses on a set of design biases:\n\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\nResponding to change over following a plan\n\nEssentially, it is based on a mistrust of machines, plans, contracts, documents, etc.\nThe Agile Manifesto was written in 2001 after a number of lighter and more flexible approaches were developed in the 1990s.\n\nSCRUM\nXP (Extreme Programming)\nEtc.\n\nIt is also a collection of methods and tools:\n\nUser stories\nScrum meetings\nSprints\nTask weighting with cards\nEtc.\n\n\n\nPrinciples\nThe Agile Manifesto articulates \\(12\\) Principles of Agile software development:\n\nCustomer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software. → The “early and often” of open source development.\nWelcome changing requirements, even in late development.\nDeliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months).\nClose, daily cooperation between business people and developers.\nProjects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted.\nFace-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location).\nWorking software is the primary measure of progress.\nSustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace.\nContinuous attention to technical excellence and good design.\nSimplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.\nBest architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.\nRegularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly.\n\nAs you can see, it’s all about giving teams the freedom and trust to creatively respond to client needs and change.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Programming for Data Science\n\nWhat are User Stories?\nUser Stories are at the heart of Agile development.\nInstead of eliciting requirements through a formal process, teams ask clients to give their wishes in verbal form:\n\nAs a [type of user]\nI want [an action or behavior]\nso that [a benefit/value]\n\nNote that in this context “users” may be any stakeholder, including developers, not just “end users.”\n\n\nProcess\nThese “stories” are written on index cards.\nThey are developed in the context of a conversation between developers and clients to clarify the meaning of the sentences.\nThese are then converted by the development team into formal requirements.\n\n\nRequirements\nRecall that requirements are the building blocks of a software design specification (a “spec”).\nHaving a clear spec allows developers to design and test code effectively.\nThere are two main kinds of requirement:\nFunctional – relating specifically to how the software will work, i.e. function.\nNon-functional (so-called) – relating to the broader purpose and context of usage.\nEach requirement relates to a feature of the product.\n\n\nPriorities\nOnce a list of requirements is developed, they are then prioritized.\nOne technique of priortization is called MSCW, pronounced “Moscow,” which stands for:\n\nMust Have: The product absolutely requires this functionality. The feature is critical to the app’s success.\nShould Have: It would be great if product had this functionality, but it isn’t absolutely required. These may be important but not as time-critical as Must-Haves.\nCould Have: The feature is value and is desirable but not necessary for the product to perform its primary tasks.\nWon’t Have: The feature is non-critical or low value. It may be out of scope of the products purpose.\n\nBy comparing each requirement with a scope definition in a project charter (not discussed here), requirements are assigned on of M, C, S, and W.\nVery often, only the Ms are kept for the first version of the product.\n\n\nMilestones\nAfter requirements have been prioritized, they are grouped into milestones.\nMilestones are time units that follow a sequence. For example, a database-driven web application might have these:\n\nStand up the development infrastructure.\nEstablish the data model and back-end architecture.\nBuild a minimally viable product.\n\nMilestones may or may not be tied to a specific date, but they do follow each other in time.\n\n\nScrums\nIn executing the project plan, the development team meets regularly in brief stand-up meetings called scrums.\nThese may be held daily but they are meant to be short and may adjourn quickly if there are not pressing issues to discuss.\nStakeholder representatives, such as the product manager, may attend too on occasion.\n\n\nClients\nAt regular intervals, clients are introduced to the process\nPrototypes, MVPs, etc. are presented.\nFeedback is elicited early and often.\n\n\nCommunication\nThe whole process is driven by a communication plan that defines such things as:\n\nFrequency of meeting.\nMode of communication – F2F, Slack, Git.\nTask management tools – Jira, Trello, Smartsheet, etc.\n\n\n\nOther Artifacts\nOther artifacts are involved in this process:\n\nThe project charter.\nThe project plan.\nA Kan Ban board.",
