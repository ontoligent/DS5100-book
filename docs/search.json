Below are some brief descriptions of the tools.\nFile Explorer. A web-based GUI to access the file system of the remote server. Can be used to create, move, and delete directories and files, and to edit the contents of files (see Editor). You can also upload and download files through this interface. The File Explorer is useful to view your remote content and manage files and directories without having to use the command line. Note that not all operations can be performed through this interface.\nFind under “Files” in the menu. \nEditor. A web-based text editor launched from the File Explorer to view and edit text files on the remote server.  Although not as sophisticated as VS Code (below), this is very useful for editing data and code files without having to use a command line editor. One advantage over VS Code is that it does not need to be launched – which means it does not time out like the Interactive Apps listed below.\nThe Editor is launched from the File Explorer.\nSSH Shell Access (Terminal). Access to the command line of the remote server.  Use this to open a terminal window to perform Linux commands directly.  Note that It is necessary to use a terminal to install and run certain programs on the remote server.\nFind under “Clusters” in the menu. \nYou can also access the remote command line via SSH on your local computer. Just enter the following on the command line of either a PC or Mac:\nssh -Y <userid>@rivanna.hpc.virginia.edu\nReplace <userid> with your UVA Net ID, e.g. abc2x. \nBe suer to be running VPN if you are accessing Rivanna from an off-grounds location."

This saves resources on the remote host, but also allows your app to launch more quickly. If you ask for an excessive amount of resources, you may wait a long time (e.g. hours) to have your app launched.\nDesktop. Access to a GUI desktop to the remote server. This provides a access to various applications on the server, including a web browser, a file explorer, and terminal windows.  Using this is not necessary if you can get by with the tools listed above.\nFind under “Interactive Apps > Desktop” in the menu.\nVS Code. Access to Visual Studio Code on the remote server. This is a fully functional instance of the IDE.\nFind under “Interactive Apps > Code Server” in the menu.\nJupyter. Access to Jupyter Lab on the remote server.

They also, typically provide GUIs but we won’t go into those here.\nThe Unix family includes all varieties of Linux and the Mac OS (which is based on FreeBSD).\nThe command line that you actually interact with – the set of commands available to you – is called a shell, and there are several shells that you can run on your system. The most typical shell in use today is called bash which stands for Bourne Again Shell, since it is an improved version of bsh (The Bourne Shell). New versions of MacOS use the Z shell (zsh). The commands in these two shells are mostly similar, but there are subtle differences.\nWindows has shells too for its command line interface. The default shell is DOS, but is also has PowerShell  as an advanced (and very capable) option.\nFor more information, check out these resources:\n\nUVA Research Computing’s Unix tutorial.\nNewham, 2005, Learning the bash Shell, O’Reilly Media.\nJeroen Janssens, 2021, Data Science From the Command Line, O’Reilly Media.\nNeal Stephenson, 1999, In the Beginning Was The Command Line.

Otherwise follow this tutorial from Microsoft.\n\n\nMove into your root directory. If on a Unix-based system (Rivanna or a Mac), you can do this by entering cd by itself.\nGenerate the key:\n\n\nEnter: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email_id@example.com\", using your email address.\nThe value ed25519 is the key type and must not be changed.\nBe sure to use the email address associated with your GitHub account in the above command.\n\n\nAt the prompt, type in a secure passphrase.\n\n\nYou don’t have to do this, but it is advised.\nCreate a memorable sentence.\nA good passphrase should have at least 15, preferably 20 characters and be difficult to guess. It should contain upper case letters, lower case letters, digits, and preferably at least one punctuation character.\n\n\nAdd the key to ssh-agent:\n\n\nEnter: eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\nEnter: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you are on a Mac and the ssh-add command gives an error saying that the file is not found or that you do not have permission, try running the following command then re-running ssh-add:\nls -al\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you’re using macOS Sierra 10.12.2 or later, you will need to modify your ~/.ssh/config file to automatically load keys into the ssh-agent and store passphrases in your keychain. Follow the instructions here (at step 2).\n\n\n\n\nPart B\nOn your GitHub account\n\nGet the public key that was just generated.\n\n\nEnter: more ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\nCopy the result to your clipboard (e.g. by blocking off the line and entering Ctrl-C).\nThe key should begin ssh-ed25519 and end with the email address you used in generating the key. In between it will have a long string of alphanumeric characters.\n\n\nOn GitHub, go to your account settings and select “SSH and GPG Keys” from the side menu.\n\n\nA link to your account settings can be found in the drop-down list produced by clicking on your user icon in the upper right of the website.\n\n\nUnder “SSH keys,” press the “New SSH Key” button.\n\n\nAdd a brief title describing the context of the key, i.e. the local machine where it was generated, e.g. Rivanna.\nChoose “Authentication Key” as the Key type.\nPaste the key into the Key text area.\nSubmit the form by pressing “Add SSH key.”\n\nYou are now good to go.

Note: Forking does not have to be performed if you are not interested in altering the code. You can clone it directlty.\nThis is done through GitHub’s web interface by clicking on the Fork button.\n\n\nClone\nCloning the repo to a workspace to which you have access, whether a local machine or a remote resource (e.g. Rivanna).\ngit clone <repo>\n\n\nAdd\nCreating or editing a file locally and then adding it to the list of files git will keep track of.\ngit add <filename>Note that you may use wildcards here, e.g. *, to add more than one file at a time.\n\n\nCommit\nCommitting the changes made to the file by adding them to the repo’s database of changes. This is accompanied by a brief, descriptive message of the changes made.\ngit commit -m \"What you did\"\n\n\nPush\nPushing the changes to the remote repo that you cloned from. This uploads both the files and the database changes to the repo.\ngit push\n\n\nPull\nPulling, i.e. downloading, any changes that have been made to the remote repo to your local repo. This usually happens if you are working in teams on the same project.\ngit pull\n\n\nPull Request\nThis is a request made to the owner of the original repo to pull in the changes you’ve made to your forked copy.\nThis is done through GitHub’s web interface. Read the docs. \n\n\nFetch Upstream\nThis refreshes the content of your forked repo with the content from the original repo.\nThis is done through GitHub’s web interface. Read the docs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is not the only pattern to use with Git. Here is another — the Git Fork-Branch-Pull Workflow\n\n\nHere is a visualization of the process:\n\n\n\nDiagram of common git workflow\n\n\nIn this diagram, the dashed lines refer to actions performed only once for a give repo. Forking and cloning are done to acquire a repo, while fetch upstream (aka sync fork) and pull requests on the GitHub server, and pull/push on your local machine, are done repeatedly as you develop and share code.\nNote also that the here “Remote workstation” may be confusing; it means remote relative to your laptop, e.g. Rivanna, which we sometimes call local relative to the GitHub repo. In any case, note that these two copies of the same repo do not communicate with each other directly, but rather through their common relationship with the GitHub hosted instance of the repo."

I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his [sic] code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.\n\nWhich sounds a lot like Eric Raymond’s “Rule of Representation” from 2003:\n\nFold knowledge into data, so program logic can be stupid and robust.\n\nWhich was just his summary of ideas like this one from Rob Pike in 1989:\n\nData dominates. If you’ve chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.\n\nWhich cites Fred Brooks from 1975:\n\nRepresentation is the Essence of Programming\n\nBeyond craftsmanship lies invention, and it is here that lean, spare, fast programs are born. Almost always these are the result of strategic breakthrough rather than tactical cleverness. Sometimes the strategic breakthrough will be a new algorithm, such as the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform or the substitution of an n log n sort for an n 2 set of comparisons.\n\n\nMuch more often, strategic breakthrough will come from redoing the representation of the data or tables. This is where the heart of your program lies. Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall be continued to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won’t usually need your flowcharts; they’ll be obvious.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSee video on Canvas."

Numeric data types are subject to mathematical operations, booleans to logical ones, and so forth.\nThere are also operations appropriate to structures. For example, list-like things have membership.\nThe relationship between types and operators is a microcosm of the relationship betweed data structures and algorithms. Data structures imply algorithms and algorithms assume data structures.\nThe w3schools site has a good summary.\nHere are some you may not have seen.\nPython offers a short-cut for most operators. When updating a variable with an operation to that variable, such as:\nYou can do this:\nPython supports many operators this way. Here are some:\nVariables, literal values, and operators are the building blocks of ebxpressions.\nFor example, the following combines three operators and four variables:\nPython employs operator precedence when evaluating expressions:\nYou can use parentheses to group them to force the order of operations you want:\nVariables and literal values can be combined:\nExpresssion can be very complex.\nExpressions evaluate to a value, just as single variables do.\nTherefore, they can be put anywhere a value is accepted."

Why?\n\nBehavior\n\nView the video for this topic on Canvas.\n\nRelatedly, mutable and immutable objects behave differently.\nFor example, when you assign a variable to another variable of a\nmutable datatype, any changes to the data are reflected by both variables.\nThe new variable is just an alias for the old variable.\nThis is only true for mutable datatypes.\nLets explore how + operator behaves differently.\nFirst, let’s create a function that will allow us\nto compare the objects as we modify them.\n\ndef compare_objects(trial:int, obj1:str, obj2:str):\n    o1 = eval(obj1)\n    o2 = eval(obj2)\n    print(f\"t{trial} {obj1} {o1} {id(o1)}\")\n    print(f\"t{trial} {obj2} {o2} {id(o2)}\")\n    print(f\"{obj1} == {obj2}:\", o1 == o2)\n\nList t1\nWe initialize a list and make a copy of it.\nNote that the two variables share the same id.\n\na0 = [1,2,3,4,5]\na1 = a0 # Make a copy of a list\ncompare_objects(1, 'a0', 'a1')\n\nt1 a0 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 140486786318976\nt1 a1 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 140486786318976\na0 == a1: True\n\n\nList t2\nNow we add to the copy and note the effects on the original.\nThe original value is also changed.\nThis is because both variables point to the same object.\n\na1 += [12] # Extend the copy\ncompare_objects(2, 'a0', 'a1')\n\nt2 a0 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12] 140486786318976\nt2 a1 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12] 140486786318976\na0 == a1: True\n\n\nList t3\nNote, however, that if we don’t use the unary operator,\nthen a1 becomes a different object!\nLutz goes into the difference between the += and the + in Ch 11 pages 360-363.\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\n\na1 = a1 + [12] # Extend the copy\ncompare_objects(3, 'a0', 'a1')\n\nt3 a0 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12] 140486786318976\nt3 a1 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 12] 140485791147584\na0 == a1: False\n\n\nList t4\nTry it with a new object copy, to avoid any possible inference between t2 and t3.\n\na2 = a0\na2 = a2 + [12] # Extend the copy\ncompare_objects(4, 'a0', 'a2')\n\nt4 a0 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12] 140486786318976\nt4 a2 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 12] 140485791151296\na0 == a2: False\n\n\nWe get the same result.\nTuple t1\nLet’s try this with a tuple.\nWe see again that both variables have the same id.\n\nb0 = (1,2,3,4,5)\nb1 = b0 # Make a copy of a tuple\ncompare_objects(1, 'b0', 'b1')\n\nt1 b0 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) 140485791255184\nt1 b1 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) 140485791255184\nb0 == b1: True\n\n\nTuple t2\nHowever, if extend the tuple with the unary operator,\n b1 becomes a new object.\nNote how this differs from the list behavior.\n\nb1 += (12,) # Extend the copy\ncompare_objects(2, 'b0', 'b1')\n\nt2 b0 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) 140485791255184\nt2 b1 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12) 140485791104832\nb0 == b1: False\n\n\nTuple t3\nIf we don’t use the unary operator, the same thing happens again.\nThe value of b1 becomes a new object because the variable has been reassigned.\n\nb1 = b1 + (12,) # Extend the copy\ncompare_objects(3, 'b0', 'b1')\n\nt3 b0 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) 140485791255184\nt3 b1 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 12) 140485791318080\nb0 == b1: False\n\n\nLet’s look at another example.\nHere is a list:\n\nfoo = ['hi']\nbar = foo\ncompare_objects(1, 'foo', 'bar')\n\nt1 foo ['hi'] 140485791149952\nt1 bar ['hi'] 140485791149952\nfoo == bar: True\n\n\n\nbar += ['bye']\ncompare_objects(2, 'foo', 'bar')\n\nt2 foo ['hi', 'bye'] 140485791149952\nt2 bar ['hi', 'bye'] 140485791149952\nfoo == bar: True\n\n\n\nbar = bar + ['bye']\ncompare_objects(2, 'foo', 'bar')\n\nt2 foo ['hi', 'bye'] 140485791149952\nt2 bar ['hi', 'bye', 'bye'] 140485791173504\nfoo == bar: False\n\n\nAnd here is a tuple:\n\nfoo1 = ('hi')\nbar1 = foo1\ncompare_objects(1, 'foo1', 'bar1')\n\nt1 foo1 hi 140486835502896\nt1 bar1 hi 140486835502896\nfoo1 == bar1: True\n\n\n\nbar1 += ('bye')\ncompare_objects(2, 'foo1', 'bar1')\n\nt2 foo1 hi 140486835502896\nt2 bar1 hibye 140485792814832\nfoo1 == bar1: False"

They don’t get a name.\nThe are “anonymous.”\nFrom Lutz 2019:\n\nBesides the def statement, Python also provides an expression form that generates function objects. Because of its similarity to a tool in the Lisp language, it’s called lambda. Like def, this expression creates a function to be called later, but it returns the function instead of assigning it to a name. This is why lambdas are sometimes known as anonymous (i.e., unnamed) functions. In practice, they are often used as a way to inline a function definition, or to defer execution of a piece of code.\n\nThe general form of a lambda function is:\n\nlambda x: x\n\n<function __main__.<lambda>(x)>\n\n\nYou can call the function like this:\n\n(lambda x: x)(2)\n\n2\n\n\nincrement x\n\n(lambda x: x+1)(5)\n\n6\n\n\nsum two variables\n\nlambda x, y: x + y\n\n<function __main__.<lambda>(x, y)>"

    "text": "Overview\nA variable’s scope is the part of a program where it is visible.\n\nScope refers to the coding region, such as a function block, from which a particular Python object is accessible.\nVisible means available or usable to the code block in question.\nIf a variable is in scope to a function, it is visible the function.\nIf it is out of scope to a function, it is not visible the function.\n\nWhen a variable is defined inside of a function, it is not visible outside of the function. * We say such variables are local to the function. * They are also removed from memory when the function completes.\nWhen a variable is defined outside of any function in a script, it is visible to any function inside of the script * We say such variables are global to the functions in the file or context in which the variables are defined. * A function can replace a global variable with local variable by defining that variable. In this case, a variable can have global and local versions in the same program.\nSometimes variable scope is called lexical scope.\nIt is helpful to have a good understanding of scope to avoid surprises and confusion.\nThe concept is easier than it may look in the abstract. Let’s look at some examples where we vary the use of local and global definitions of x."

    "text": "Lutz on Scoping\nHere’s an excerpt from Lutz, Chapter 17. Please read the whole thing.\nThe enclosing module is a global scope. Each module is a global scope—that is, a namespace in which variables created (assigned) at the top level of the module file live. Global variables become attributes of a module object to the outside world after imports but can also be used as simple variables within the module file itself.\nThe global scope spans a single file only. Don’t be fooled by the word “global” here—names at the top level of a file are global to code within that single file only. There is really no notion of a single, all-encompassing global file-based scope in Python. Instead, names are partitioned into modules, and you must always import a module explicitly if you want to be able to use the names its file defines. When you hear “global” in Python, think “module.”\nAssigned names are local unless declared global or nonlocal. By default, all the names assigned inside a function definition are put in the local scope (the namespace associated with the function call). If you need to assign a name that lives at the top level of the module enclosing the function, you can do so by declaring it in a global statement inside the function. If you need to assign a name that lives in an enclosing def, as of Python 3.X you can do so by declaring it in a nonlocal statement.\nAll other names are enclosing function locals, globals, or built-ins. Names not assigned a value in the function definition are assumed to be enclosing scope locals, defined in a physically surrounding def statement; globals that live in the enclosing module’s namespace; or built-ins in the predefined built-ins module Python provides.\nEach call to a function creates a new local scope. Every time you call a function, you create a new local scope—that is, a namespace in which the names created inside that function will usually live. You can think of each def statement (and lambda expression) as defining a new local scope, but the local scope actually corresponds to a function call. Because Python allows functions to call themselves to loop—an advanced technique known as recursion and noted briefly in Chapter 9 when we explored comparisons—each active call receives its own copy of the function’s local variables. Recursion is useful in functions we write as well, to process structures whose shapes can’t be predicted ahead of time; we’ll explore it more fully in Chapter 19.\nAnd here is a nice visualization of scopes:\n\n\n\nCar with tinted glass\n\n\nPlease read Lutz, Chapter 17 for a good overview of scoping."

Sometimes it is assumed that the reader knows what this means.\nIf you’ve never heard of namespaces, or are unsure of what they are, here’s a brief explanation.\nA namespace is a system that allows for a unique name to associated with each and every object in a Python program. * Remember that an object can be anything in Python, not just variable, e.g. a function or a class. * Python maintains namespaces internally as dictionaries.\nA good analogy to a namespace system is the file system on a computer. You can have files of the same name so long as they are in different folders. The complete name of the file is actually the filename and the names of its parent folders, i.e. the path to the file in the file system.\nAnother anology is in human names – personal names and family names, i.e. first and last names in European countries. These in turn might be contained by larger social groupings.\nFinally, another analogy is home addresses – house numbers and street names can be reused based on their “path” in the tree of geographic entities that include cities, states, nations, etc.\nSimilarly, Python understands what exact method or variable one is trying to point to in the code, depending upon the namespace.\nNote that in each of these cases, the data structure is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which is universal structure for organizing unique names."

    "text": "Some Difficulties\nIt is pretty easy to import CSV files this way, but there are many difficulties you are likely to encounter if you use this as your default pattern for importing data. Here are just a few: - Not all sources are well-formed. They may have delimitters that are complex to parse, and the the data themselve may be hard to parse. - You have to keep the column names in a separate list or vector and then associate them with the data if and when necessary. - You have to convert each column vector into its appropriate data type yourself. Or, you have to create separate 2D arrays for each collection of columns with a common data type. This process also invovles human inspection of the file, as opposed to have a program try to figure it out for you.\nFor these reasons, other tools such as Pandas were created to make the work of a data scientist a bit easier and more productive."

    "text": "Pandas Data Frames\nJust as NumPy introduces the n-dimensional array as a new data structure to Python, so Pandas introduces two:\nThe Series: a 1-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.\nThe DataFrame: a 2-dimensional labeled array with columns of potentially different types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Pandas used to have a 3-dimensional structure called a panel, but it has been removed from the library.\nIronically, the name “pandas” was partly derived the word “panel”: \\(pan(el)-da(ta)-s\\).\nTo handle higher dimensional data, the Pandas team suggests using XArray, which also build on NumPy arrays.\n\n\n\nBy far, the most important data structure in Pandas is the dataframe (sometimes spelled “data frame”), with the series playing a supporting – but crucial – role.\nIn fact, dataframe objects are built out of series objects.\nSo, to understand what a dataframe is and how it behaves, you need to understand what is series is and how it is constructed.\nBefore going into that, here are two quick observations about dataframes:\nFirst, dataframes are inspired by the R structure of the same name.\nThey have many similarities, but there are fundamental differences between the two that go beyond mere language differences.\nMost important is the Pandas dataframes have indexes, whereas R dataframes do not.\nSecond, it is helpful to think of Pandas as wrapper around NumPy and Matplotlib that makes it much easier to perform common operations, like select data by column name or visualizing plots.\nBut this comes at a cost – Pandas is slower than NumPy.\nThis represents the classic trade-off between ease-of-use for humnas and machine performance."

Unnamed: 0 is just the row number as index.\nThe purpose of the test performed in each trial seems to be see which solutions are best at overcoming divied attention in the performance of those tasks.\nLet’s restructure our data to reflect these assumptions.\n\nattention1 = attention.set_index(['attention','solutions','subject']).sort_index().drop('Unnamed: 0', axis=1)\n\n\nattention1.head(20)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      score\n    \n    \n      attention\n      solutions\n      subject\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      divided\n      1\n      1\n      2.0\n    \n    \n      2\n      3.0\n    \n    \n      3\n      3.0\n    \n    \n      4\n      5.0\n    \n    \n      5\n      4.0\n    \n    \n      6\n      5.0\n    \n    \n      7\n      5.0\n    \n    \n      8\n      5.0\n    \n    \n      9\n      2.0\n    \n    \n      10\n      6.0\n    \n    \n      2\n      1\n      4.0\n    \n    \n      2\n      4.0\n    \n    \n      3\n      5.0\n    \n    \n      4\n      7.0\n    \n    \n      5\n      5.0\n    \n    \n      6\n      5.0\n    \n    \n      7\n      4.5\n    \n    \n      8\n      7.0\n    \n    \n      9\n      3.0\n    \n    \n      10\n      5.0\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nWe can use .unstack() to provide a nice, synoptic view of these data.\n\nattention2 = attention1.unstack()\nattention2.fillna('')\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n      score\n    \n    \n      \n      subject\n      1\n      2\n      3\n      4\n      5\n      6\n      7\n      8\n      9\n      10\n      11\n      12\n      13\n      14\n      15\n      16\n      17\n      18\n      19\n      20\n    \n    \n      attention\n      solutions\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      divided\n      1\n      2.0\n      3.0\n      3.0\n      5.0\n      4.0\n      5.0\n      5.0\n      5.0\n      2.0\n      6.0\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      2\n      4.0\n      4.0\n      5.0\n      7.0\n      5.0\n      5.0\n      4.5\n      7.0\n      3.0\n      5.0\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      3\n      7.0\n      5.0\n      6.0\n      5.0\n      8.0\n      6.0\n      6.0\n      8.0\n      7.0\n      6.0\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      focused\n      1\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      6.0\n      8.0\n      6.0\n      8.0\n      8.0\n      6.0\n      7.0\n      7.0\n      5.0\n      6.0\n    \n    \n      2\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      5.0\n      9.0\n      5.0\n      8.0\n      8.0\n      8.0\n      7.0\n      8.0\n      6.0\n      6.0\n    \n    \n      3\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      6.0\n      8.0\n      9.0\n      7.0\n      7.0\n      7.0\n      6.0\n      6.0\n      6.0\n      5.0\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nWe can see clearly the data from two groups by attention, each consisting of 10 subjects, each employing three solutions.\nBy unstacking again, we can get a sense of which solution worked best.\n\nattention2.mean(1).unstack().T.style.background_gradient(axis=None)\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      attention\n      divided\n      focused\n    \n    \n      solutions\n       \n       \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1\n      4.000000\n      6.700000\n    \n    \n      2\n      4.950000\n      7.000000\n    \n    \n      3\n      6.400000\n      6.700000\n    \n  \n\n\n\nIt appears the solution 3 performed well.\n\n\n.stack()\nStack is the opposite of .unstack(), of course. It will project a column name series into the values of a single column.\nDetails\nLet look at this with the taxis database.\n\ntaxis = sns.load_dataset('taxis')\n\n\ntaxis.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      pickup\n      dropoff\n      passengers\n      distance\n      fare\n      tip\n      tolls\n      total\n      color\n      payment\n      pickup_zone\n      dropoff_zone\n      pickup_borough\n      dropoff_borough\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      2019-03-23 20:21:09\n      2019-03-23 20:27:24\n      1\n      1.60\n      7.0\n      2.15\n      0.0\n      12.95\n      yellow\n      credit card\n      Lenox Hill West\n      UN/Turtle Bay South\n      Manhattan\n      Manhattan\n    \n    \n      1\n      2019-03-04 16:11:55\n      2019-03-04 16:19:00\n      1\n      0.79\n      5.0\n      0.00\n      0.0\n      9.30\n      yellow\n      cash\n      Upper West Side South\n      Upper West Side South\n      Manhattan\n      Manhattan\n    \n    \n      2\n      2019-03-27 17:53:01\n      2019-03-27 18:00:25\n      1\n      1.37\n      7.5\n      2.36\n      0.0\n      14.16\n      yellow\n      credit card\n      Alphabet City\n      West Village\n      Manhattan\n      Manhattan\n    \n    \n      3\n      2019-03-10 01:23:59\n      2019-03-10 01:49:51\n      1\n      7.70\n      27.0\n      6.15\n      0.0\n      36.95\n      yellow\n      credit card\n      Hudson Sq\n      Yorkville West\n      Manhattan\n      Manhattan\n    \n    \n      4\n      2019-03-30 13:27:42\n      2019-03-30 13:37:14\n      3\n      2.16\n      9.0\n      1.10\n      0.0\n      13.40\n      yellow\n      credit card\n      Midtown East\n      Yorkville West\n      Manhattan\n      Manhattan\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\ntaxis1 = taxis.set_index(['pickup','dropoff']).sort_index().stack().to_frame('val')\ntaxis1.index.names = ['pickup','dropoff','field']\n\n\ntaxis1.sample(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      val\n    \n    \n      pickup\n      dropoff\n      field\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      2019-03-23 13:13:20\n      2019-03-23 13:15:13\n      dropoff_zone\n      Hudson Sq\n    \n    \n      2019-03-21 01:30:10\n      2019-03-21 01:50:15\n      tolls\n      0.0\n    \n    \n      2019-03-04 14:13:31\n      2019-03-04 14:24:15\n      tolls\n      0.0\n    \n    \n      2019-03-06 21:00:00\n      2019-03-06 21:04:45\n      passengers\n      1\n    \n    \n      2019-03-08 21:43:33\n      2019-03-08 21:45:48\n      tolls\n      0.0\n    \n    \n      2019-03-07 14:27:58\n      2019-03-07 14:45:49\n      pickup_borough\n      Queens\n    \n    \n      2019-03-14 15:11:21\n      2019-03-14 15:21:02\n      dropoff_zone\n      Upper West Side North\n    \n    \n      2019-03-14 16:49:58\n      2019-03-14 17:07:29\n      fare\n      14.5\n    \n    \n      2019-03-13 16:16:05\n      2019-03-13 16:28:11\n      dropoff_borough\n      Manhattan\n    \n    \n      2019-03-10 16:13:48\n      2019-03-10 16:17:53\n      total\n      7.8\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\ntaxis1.loc['2019-02-28 23:29:03']\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n      val\n    \n    \n      dropoff\n      field\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      2019-02-28 23:32:35\n      passengers\n      1\n    \n    \n      distance\n      0.9\n    \n    \n      fare\n      5.0\n    \n    \n      tip\n      0.0\n    \n    \n      tolls\n      0.0\n    \n    \n      total\n      6.3\n    \n    \n      color\n      green\n    \n    \n      payment\n      cash\n    \n    \n      pickup_zone\n      Old Astoria\n    \n    \n      dropoff_zone\n      Long Island City/Queens Plaza\n    \n    \n      pickup_borough\n      Queens\n    \n    \n      dropoff_borough\n      Queens"

    "text": "The Trinity\nOOP theory states that classes exhibit three fundamental properties that make them powerful:\n\nEncapsulation\nInheritance\nPolymorphism\n\nEncapsulation means that objects are self-contained. They have their own scope, data, and logic. Ideally, they can be deployed in any context and be shielded from external states.\n\nObjects are meant to be black boxes to users: they should only be interacted with via the methods and attributes provided.\nNothing else should influence the state of the object except what it contains and what is passed to it.\n\nInheritance means that classes can be subclasses of other classes and thereby inherit their ancestor attributes and methods. - Some programming languages allow only single inheritance – classes can have one parent. - Python supports multiple inheritance, but this can be complicated to use.\nPolymorphism means that methods can perform different behaviors based on the arguments they are passed. - That is, a function can be defined more than once in a class, as long as it each has a unique signature. - A signature is the particular pattern of arguments (parameters) a method has.\nToday, we are only going to focus on encapsulation …\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a movement to implement only this concept.\nMicrosoft, for example, developed a component-based approach to programming, where components are encapsulated unites of code without the complexity of inheritance."

    "text": "Introduction\nClasses are a way organizing code into bundles of variables and functions called attributes and methods.\nEach class models some thing — a thing in the world, a process, a model, or just some convenient way of grouping code.\nFor example, a logistic regression model would have attributes like:\n\nweights\nan optional intercept term\nthe maximum number of iterations\n\nThese attributes help describe the object; they give the object’s state.\nThe logistic regression model would have functionality such as:\n\nthe optimization routine used in training\na prediction function\n\nThe behavior, or functionality, is supported by methods, which are functions included in the class.\nHere are a couple of others way to think of a class:\n\nIt provides a template for creating an object and for working with the object.\nIt constitutes a kind of definition of something in the world.\n\n\nA First Example\nOk, let’s look at examples, starting with a very small, simple class.\nThe class contains:\n\na name Ferrari458\na docstring for a quick description\nan attribute, which is number of cylinders in the engine\na method\n\n\nclass Ferrari458:\n    \"\"\"This is a Ferrari 458 object\"\"\"\n    cylinders = 8\n\n    def print_origin(self):\n        return 'I was built in Italy!'\n\nYou can learn about the class by printing the docstring:\n\nFerrari458.__doc__\n\n'This is a Ferrari 458 object'\n\n\nYou can also get detailed help like this:\n\nhelp(Ferrari458)\n\nHelp on class Ferrari458 in module __main__:\n\nclass Ferrari458(builtins.object)\n |  This is a Ferrari 458 object\n |  \n |  Methods defined here:\n |  \n |  print_origin(self)\n |  \n |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n |  Data descriptors defined here:\n |  \n |  __dict__\n |      dictionary for instance variables (if defined)\n |  \n |  __weakref__\n |      list of weak references to the object (if defined)\n |  \n |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n |  Data and other attributes defined here:\n |  \n |  cylinders = 8\n\n\n\nNext, we create an object from the class (also called an instance of the class).\nIt is called like a function with no parameters.\nThe process is called instantiation.\n\nmyferrari = Ferrari458()\n\nWe show the number of cylinders by using the object.attribute format:\n\nmyferrari.cylinders\n\n8\n\n\nThen we call its method .print_origin() to learn where this sweet machine was built.\n\nmyferrari.print_origin()\n\n'I was built in Italy!'\n\n\nAs a convention, methods take self as their first argument. Methods can use self.attribute to extract their attributes.\nHere is an example, with method get_cylinders.\n\nclass Ferrari458_v2:\n    \"\"\"This is a Ferrari 458 object\"\"\"\n    cylinders = 8\n\n    def print_origin(self):\n        return 'I was built in Italy!'\n\n    def get_cylinders(self):\n        return self.cylinders\n\n\nmyferrari = Ferrari458_v2()\n\n\nmyferrari.get_cylinders()\n\n8"

    "section": "Mutable Class Attributes",
    "text": "Mutable Class Attributes\nThere is an interesting gotcha regarding class attributes in Python.\nLists and other mutable data structures can be class attributes and yet have their values modified by instances.\nThis is kind of weird, and you should look out for it.\nTo demonstrate, we define a class with two instance variables, one a scalar and one a list.\nWe define a method to alter the value of each.\nWe also define a method compare the state of the instance with that of its class.\n\nclass MyTest():\n    \n    # Two class attributes\n    foo = 0  \n    bar = [] \n    \n    def add_one(self):\n        \"A method to alter the values of the class attributes.\"\n        self.foo += 1       \n        self.bar.append(1)  \n        \n    def replace_bar(self, new_list = []):\n        \"A method to redefine the class list attribute.\"\n        self.bar = new_list \n        \n    def compare_states(self):\n        \"A method to compare the state of instance to that of its class.\"\n        print('i.foo =', self.foo)\n        print('c.foo =', __class__.foo) # Notice how we can refer to an instance's class\n        print('i.bar =', self.bar)\n        print('c.bar =', __class__.bar)\n        \n\nNow let’s run some tests.\nWe define and instance and change nothing.\n\ntest1 = MyTest()\n\n\ntest1.compare_states()\n\ni.foo = 0\nc.foo = 0\ni.bar = []\nc.bar = []\n\n\nNow let’s increment the attributes and see the results.\n\ntest1.add_one()\n\n\ntest1.compare_states()\n\ni.foo = 1\nc.foo = 0\ni.bar = [1]\nc.bar = [1]\n\n\nThe method does disconnect the instance foo from the class foo.\nBut it does not disconnect the instance bar from the class bar.\nInstead, a change that took place in one instance affects the state of all other instances!\nThe difference is that foo is a scalar, and bar is a list, i.e. mutable data structure.\nWe do it again to drive the point home.\n\ntest1.add_one()\n\n\ntest1.compare_states()\n\ni.foo = 2\nc.foo = 0\ni.bar = [1, 1]\nc.bar = [1, 1]\n\n\nNow, let’s replace list itself in the instance.\n\ntest1.replace_bar()\n\n\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(\"Iter\", i)\n    test1.add_one()\n    test1.compare_states()\n    print()\n\nIter 0\ni.foo = 3\nc.foo = 0\ni.bar = [1]\nc.bar = [1, 1]\n\nIter 1\ni.foo = 4\nc.foo = 0\ni.bar = [1, 1]\nc.bar = [1, 1]\n\nIter 2\ni.foo = 5\nc.foo = 0\ni.bar = [1, 1, 1]\nc.bar = [1, 1]\n\nIter 3\ni.foo = 6\nc.foo = 0\ni.bar = [1, 1, 1, 1]\nc.bar = [1, 1]\n\nIter 4\ni.foo = 7\nc.foo = 0\ni.bar = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nc.bar = [1, 1]\n\n\n\nNotice that now the class list is not altered by the instance list.\nIt remains in the state before the list itself was re-assigned by the instance.\nThis is because we redefined the list itself, not just its content.\nLet’s define a second instance.\n\ntest2 = MyTest()\n\n\ntest2.compare_states()\n\ni.foo = 0\nc.foo = 0\ni.bar = [1, 1]\nc.bar = [1, 1]\n\n\nThe new instance has the original value of foo.\nHowever, notice it starts off with the modified value of bar before it was replaced.\nWe do it a few more times to drive the point home.\n\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(\"Iter\", i)\n    test2.add_one()\n    test2.compare_states()\n    print()\n\nIter 0\ni.foo = 1\nc.foo = 0\ni.bar = [1, 1, 1]\nc.bar = [1, 1, 1]\n\nIter 1\ni.foo = 2\nc.foo = 0\ni.bar = [1, 1, 1, 1]\nc.bar = [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nIter 2\ni.foo = 3\nc.foo = 0\ni.bar = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nc.bar = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nIter 3\ni.foo = 4\nc.foo = 0\ni.bar = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nc.bar = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nIter 4\ni.foo = 5\nc.foo = 0\ni.bar = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nc.bar = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n\n\nSome take-aways:\n\nClass attribute changes affect those attributes in all of it instances …\n… unless the instance assigns a value to the attribute.\nHowever, appending to a list — or, more generally, modifying data in a mutable data structure — does not count as an assignment operation. The instance changes will affect the class state.\nBottom line: DEFINE CLASS ATTRIBUTES WITH CAUTION."

Defining the scale can be difficult.\n\nTwo kinds of requirements matching are the following:\n\nVerification: Shows that the code meets the requirement specification. You verify that I wrote the program you asked me to write.\nValidation: Shows that the code meets the requirements. You show that the program is a valid solution to the user’s problem, but not necessarily the best.\n\nSpecifications are very important. Not only are they used to guide the creation of the project, but also they’re vital for program testing and verification.\n\nThat is, if you don’t have specifications for the product, you cannot verify that you’re doing the right thing.\nLikewise, if behavior is not defined, then it becomes difficult to know what is incorrect behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSpecifications are rarely perfect. They can change over time for a variety of reasons.\nIn fact, some have joked that programming is the act of “debugging the spec”. We’ll learn more about this when we cover project management."

The programmer does unit testing as part of the coding process.\nThis assumes that code is componential, i.e. that the smallest units are functionally independent and can be combined in principled ways.\nThis raises the issue of writing well-designed functions and classes.\n\nTwo other kinds of testing are integration and acceptance (beta) testing, which are out of the scope of this lesson.

They are dependent on the file system.\n\n\n\n\nNamespace packages are composed of portions. They do not have an init.py file. Portions can be anywhere. They are not dependent on the file system. They may be virtual.\n\n\n\n\n\nImport statements bring modules into modules.

Think of this as the project directory.\n\n\n\n\nFile and directory names should follow variable and function naming conventions since they will be used to create the names used in the importing program.\n\n\n\n\nGlobal scope is always the file enclosing it, regardless of which module it is ultimately called from."

    "text": "R Data Structures\nBasic R comes with several data structures:\n\nVector\nMatrix\nArray\nList\nData frame\n\nA vector is what is called an array in many other programming languages\n\nA collection of cells with a fixed size where all cells hold the same data type (integers or characters or reals or whatever).\n\nA matrix is a two-dimensional vector (fixed size, all cell types the same).\nAn array is a vector with one or more dimensions.\n\nSo, an array with one dimension is (almost) the same as a vector.\nAn array with two dimensions is (almost) the same as a matrix.\nAn array with three or more dimensions is an n-dimensional array.\n\nA list can hold items of different types and the list size can be increased on the fly.\n\nList contents can be accessed either by index (like mylist[[1]]) or by name (like mylist$age).\n\nA data frame is called a table in many languages.\n\nEach column holds the same type, and the columns can have header names.\nA data frame is essential a kind of a list — a list of vectors each with the same length, but of varying data types.\n\nThe two most frequently used are Vector and Data frame.\nSo, we will look at vectors and data frames.\n\nWe will also look at lists since they are used internally to construct data frames.\n\n\nVectors and c()\nA vector is a sequence of data elements of the same basic type.\nMembers in a vector are officially called components, but many call them members.\nVectors may be created with the c() function (“c” stands for combine).\nHere is a vector of three numeric values 2, 3 and 5.\n\nc(2, 3, 5) \n\n[1] 2 3 5\n\n\nAnd here is a vector of logical values.\n\nc(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE) \n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nA vector can contain character strings.\n\nc(\"aa\", \"bb\", \"cc\", \"dd\", \"ee\") \n\n[1] \"aa\" \"bb\" \"cc\" \"dd\" \"ee\"\n\n\n\nVectors from sequences using :, seq(), and rep()\nVectors can be made out of sequences which may be generated in a few ways.\n\ns1 <- 2:5\ns1\n\n[1] 2 3 4 5\n\n\nThe seq() function is like Python’s range().\n\ns2 <- seq(from=1, to=5, by=2)  # You can drop the argument names write seq(1,5,2)\ns2\n\n[1] 1 3 5\n\n\nThe rep() function will create a series of repeated values:\n\ns3 <- rep(1, 5)\ns3\n\n[1] 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\n\n\nlength()\nThe number of members in a vector is given by the length() function.\n\nlength(c(\"aa\", \"bb\", \"cc\", \"dd\", \"ee\")) \n\n[1] 5\n\n\n\n\nCombining Vectors with c()\nVectors can be combined via the function c().\n\nn <- c(2, 3, 5) \ns <- c(\"aa\", \"bb\", \"cc\", \"dd\", \"ee\") \n c(n, s) \n\n[1] \"2\"  \"3\"  \"5\"  \"aa\" \"bb\" \"cc\" \"dd\" \"ee\"\n\n\n\n\nValue Coercion\nNotice how the numeric values are being coerced into character strings when the two vectors are combined.\nThis is necessary so as to maintain the same primitive data type for members in the same vector.\n\n\nVector Math\nArithmetic operations of vectors are performed member-by-member, i.e., member-wise.\nFor example, suppose we have two vectors a and b.\n\na <- c(1, 3, 5, 7) \nb <- c(1, 2, 4, 8)\n\nThen, if we multiply a by 5, we would get a vector with each of its members multiplied by 5.\n\n5 * a \n\n[1]  5 15 25 35\n\n\nAnd if we add a and b together, the sum would be a vector whose members are the sum of the corresponding members from a and b.\n\na + b\n\n[1]  2  5  9 15\n\n\nSimilarly for subtraction, multiplication and division, we get new vectors via member-wise operations.\n\na - b \n\n[1]  0  1  1 -1\n\n\n\na * b \n\n[1]  1  6 20 56\n\n\n\na / b \n\n[1] 1.000 1.500 1.250 0.875\n\n\n\n\nThe Recycling Rule\nIf two vectors are of unequal length, the shorter one will be recycled in order to match the longer vector.\nFor example, the following vectors u and v have different lengths, and their sum is computed by recycling values of the shorter vector u.\n\nu <- c(10, 20, 30) \nv <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) \nu + v \n\n[1] 11 22 33 14 25 36 17 28 39\n\n\n\n\nVector Indexes\nWe retrieve values in a vector by declaring an index inside a single square bracket index [] operator.\nVector indexes are 1-based.\n\ns <- c(\"aa\", \"bb\", \"cc\", \"dd\", \"ee\") \ns[3] \n\n[1] \"cc\"\n\n\n\n\nNegative Indexing\nUnlike Python, if the index is negative, it will remove the member whose position has the same absolute value as the negative index.\nIt really does mean subtraction!\nFor example, the following creates a vector slice with the third member removed.\n\ns[-3] \n\n[1] \"aa\" \"bb\" \"dd\" \"ee\"\n\n\n\n\nOut-of-Range Indexes\nValues for out-of-range indexes are reported as NA.\n\ns[10] \n\n[1] NA\n\n\n\n\nNumeric Index Vectors\nA new vector can be sliced from a given vector with a numeric vector passed to the indexing operator.\nIndex vectors consist of member positions of the original vector to be retrieved.\nHere we see how to retrieve a vector slice containing the second and third members of a given vector s.\n\ns <- c(\"aa\", \"bb\", \"cc\", \"dd\", \"ee\") \ns[c(2, 3)] \n\n[1] \"bb\" \"cc\"\n\n\n\n\nDuplicate Indexes\nThe index vector allows duplicate values. Hence the following retrieves a member twice in one operation.\n\ns[c(2, 3, 3)] \n\n[1] \"bb\" \"cc\" \"cc\"\n\n\n\n\nOut-of-Order Indexes\nThe index vector can even be out-of-order. Here is a vector slice with the order of first and second members reversed.\n\ns[c(2, 1, 3)] \n\n[1] \"bb\" \"aa\" \"cc\"\n\n\n\n\nRange Index\nTo produce a vector slice between two indexes, we can use the colon operator “:”. This can be convenient for situations involving large vectors.\n\ns[2:4] \n\n[1] \"bb\" \"cc\" \"dd\"\n\n\n\n\nLogical Index Vectors\nA new vector can be sliced from a given vector with a logical index vector.\nThe logical vector must the same length as the original vector.\nIts members are TRUE if the corresponding members in the original vector are to be included in the slice, and FALSE if otherwise.\n\nThis is what we called boolean filtering and masking in Python.\n\nFor example, consider the following vector s of length 5.\n\ns <- c(\"aa\", \"bb\", \"cc\", \"dd\", \"ee\")\n\nTo retrieve the the second and fourth members of s, we define a logical vector L of the same length, and have its second and fourth members set as TRUE.\n\nL = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)\ns[L] \n\n[1] \"bb\" \"dd\"\n\n\nThe code can be abbreviated into a single line.\n\ns[c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)]\n\n[1] \"bb\" \"dd\"\n\n\n\n\nNaming Vector Members with names()\nWe can assign names to vector members.\n\nv <- c(\"Mary\", \"Sue\") \nnames(v) <- c(\"First\", \"Last\") \nv \n\n First   Last \n\"Mary\"  \"Sue\" \n\n\nNow we can retrieve the first member by name.\n\nv[\"First\"] \n\n First \n\"Mary\" \n\n\nWe can also reverse the order with a character string index vector.\n\nv[c(\"Last\", \"First\")] \n\n  Last  First \n \"Sue\" \"Mary\" \n\n\n\n\n\nLists\nA list is a generic vector containing other objects.\nThe following variable x is a list containing copies of three vectors n, s, b, and a numeric value 3.\n\nn <- c(2, 3, 5) \ns <- c(\"aa\", \"bb\", \"cc\", \"dd\", \"ee\") \nb <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE) \n\nx <- list(n, s, b, 3)   # x contains copies of n, s, b\nx\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 2 3 5\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"aa\" \"bb\" \"cc\" \"dd\" \"ee\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 3\n\n\nNote that odd bracket notation.\nEach list member contains a vector.\n\nList Slicing\nWe retrieve a list slice with the single square bracket [] operator.\nThe following is a slice containing the second member of x, which is a copy of s.\n\nx[2] \n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"aa\" \"bb\" \"cc\" \"dd\" \"ee\"\n\n\nWith an index vector, we can retrieve a slice with multiple members.\nHere a slice containing the second and fourth members of x.\n\nx[c(2, 4)] \n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"aa\" \"bb\" \"cc\" \"dd\" \"ee\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 3\n\n\n\n\nMember Reference with [[]]\nTo reference a list member directly, we use the double square bracket [[]] operator.\nThe following object x[[2]] is the second member of x.\nIn other words, x[[2]] is a copy of s, but is not a slice containing s or its copy.\n\nx[2]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"aa\" \"bb\" \"cc\" \"dd\" \"ee\"\n\n\n\nx[[2]]\n\n[1] \"aa\" \"bb\" \"cc\" \"dd\" \"ee\"\n\n\nWe can modify its content directly.\n\nx[[2]][1] = \"ta\" \nx[[2]] \n\n[1] \"ta\" \"bb\" \"cc\" \"dd\" \"ee\"\n\n\nAnd s is unaffected.\n\ns \n\n[1] \"aa\" \"bb\" \"cc\" \"dd\" \"ee\"\n\n\n\n\n\nData Frames\nA data frame is used for storing data tables.\nIt is essentially a list of vectors of equal length. For example, the following variable df is a data frame containing three vectors n, s, b.\nYou can think of a data frame is a special kind of list.\n\nn <- c(2, 3, 5) \ns <- c(\"aa\", \"bb\", \"cc\") \nb <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) \ndf <- data.frame(n, s, b) # df is a data frame\ndf\n\n  n  s     b\n1 2 aa  TRUE\n2 3 bb FALSE\n3 5 cc  TRUE\n\n\nNotice that data frames are built column-wise – this is true of Pandas data frames as well.\nThe top line of the data frame is the header; it contains the column names.\nThe data type is list below the column name.\nEach horizontal line afterward denotes a data row, which begins with the name of the row, and then followed by the actual data.\nEach data member of a row is called a cell.\n\nBuilt-in Data Frames\nHere is a built-in data frame in R, called mtcars.\n\nmtcars \n\n                     mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4           21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag       21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710          22.8   4 108.0  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive      21.4   6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout   18.7   8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant             18.1   6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\nDuster 360          14.3   8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84  0  0    3    4\nMerc 240D           24.4   4 146.7  62 3.69 3.190 20.00  1  0    4    2\nMerc 230            22.8   4 140.8  95 3.92 3.150 22.90  1  0    4    2\nMerc 280            19.2   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30  1  0    4    4\nMerc 280C           17.8   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90  1  0    4    4\nMerc 450SE          16.4   8 275.8 180 3.07 4.070 17.40  0  0    3    3\nMerc 450SL          17.3   8 275.8 180 3.07 3.730 17.60  0  0    3    3\nMerc 450SLC         15.2   8 275.8 180 3.07 3.780 18.00  0  0    3    3\nCadillac Fleetwood  10.4   8 472.0 205 2.93 5.250 17.98  0  0    3    4\nLincoln Continental 10.4   8 460.0 215 3.00 5.424 17.82  0  0    3    4\nChrysler Imperial   14.7   8 440.0 230 3.23 5.345 17.42  0  0    3    4\nFiat 128            32.4   4  78.7  66 4.08 2.200 19.47  1  1    4    1\nHonda Civic         30.4   4  75.7  52 4.93 1.615 18.52  1  1    4    2\nToyota Corolla      33.9   4  71.1  65 4.22 1.835 19.90  1  1    4    1\nToyota Corona       21.5   4 120.1  97 3.70 2.465 20.01  1  0    3    1\nDodge Challenger    15.5   8 318.0 150 2.76 3.520 16.87  0  0    3    2\nAMC Javelin         15.2   8 304.0 150 3.15 3.435 17.30  0  0    3    2\nCamaro Z28          13.3   8 350.0 245 3.73 3.840 15.41  0  0    3    4\nPontiac Firebird    19.2   8 400.0 175 3.08 3.845 17.05  0  0    3    2\nFiat X1-9           27.3   4  79.0  66 4.08 1.935 18.90  1  1    4    1\nPorsche 914-2       26.0   4 120.3  91 4.43 2.140 16.70  0  1    5    2\nLotus Europa        30.4   4  95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.90  1  1    5    2\nFord Pantera L      15.8   8 351.0 264 4.22 3.170 14.50  0  1    5    4\nFerrari Dino        19.7   6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.50  0  1    5    6\nMaserati Bora       15.0   8 301.0 335 3.54 3.570 14.60  0  1    5    8\nVolvo 142E          21.4   4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.60  1  1    4    2\n\n\nTo retrieve data in a cell, we would enter its row and column coordinates in the single square bracket [ ] operator.\nThe two coordinates are separated by a comma, e.g. [row, col].\nHere is the cell value from the first row, second column of mtcars.\n\nmtcars[1, 2] \n\n[1] 6\n\n\nWe can use names instead of the numeric coordinates.\n\nmtcars[\"Mazda RX4\", \"cyl\"] \n\n[1] 6\n\n\nLastly, the number of data rows in the data frame is given by the nrow() function.\n\nnrow(mtcars)    # number of data rows \n\n[1] 32\n\n\nAnd the number of columns of a data frame is given by the ncol() function.\n\nncol(mtcars)    # number of columns \n\n[1] 11\n\n\n\ndim(mtcars)\n\n[1] 32 11\n\n\nFurther details of the mtcars data set is available in the R documentation.\n\nhelp(mtcars)\n\n\n\nPreview with head()\nInstead of printing out the entire data frame, it is often desirable to preview it with the head function beforehand\n\nhead(mtcars) \n\n                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\n\n\n\n\nData Frame Column Vectors\nWe reference a data frame column with the double square bracket [[]] operator, just as we do for lists.\nFor example, to retrieve the ninth column vector of the built-in data set mtcars, we write mtcars[[9]]\n\nmtcars[[9]] \n\n [1] 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\nWe can retrieve the same column vector by its name\n\nmtcars[[\"am\"]] \n\n [1] 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\nWe can also retrieve with the “$” operator in lieu of the double square bracket operator\n\nmtcars$am \n\n [1] 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\nYet another way to retrieve the same column vector is to use the single square bracket “[]” operator.

For this, we can use the function read.xls from the gdata package. It reads from an Excel spreadsheet and returns a data frame. The following shows how to load an Excel spreadsheet named “mydata.xls”. This method requires Perl runtime to be present in the system\n\n##library(gdata)                   # load gdata package \n##help(read.xls)                   # documentation \n##mydata <- read.xls(\"mydata.xls\")  # read from first sheet\n\nAlternatively, we can use the function loadWorkbook from the XLConnect package to read the entire workbook, and then load the worksheets with readWorksheet. The XLConnect package requires Java to be pre-installed\n\n##library(XLConnect)               # load XLConnect package \n##wk <- loadWorkbook(\"mydata.xls\") \n##df <- readWorksheet(wk, sheet=\"Sheet1\")\n\nTable Files\nA data table can resides in a text file.\nThe cells inside the table are separated by blank characters.\nHere is an example of a table with 4 rows and 3 columns.\n100 a1 b1 \n200 a2 b2 \n300 a3 b3 \n400 a4 b4\nNow copy and paste the table above in a file named “mydata.txt” with a text editor.\nThen load the data into the workspace with the function read.table\n\nmydata <- read.table(\"mydata.txt\")  # read text file \n\nWarning in read.table(\"mydata.txt\"): incomplete final line found by\nreadTableHeader on 'mydata.txt'\n\nmydata                             # print data frame \n\n   V1 V2 V3\n1 100 a1 b1\n2 200 a2 b2\n3 300 a3 b3\n4 400 a4 b4\n\n\nCSV Files\nThe sample data can also be in comma separated values (CSV) format. Each cell inside such data file is separated by a special character, which usually is a comma, although other characters can be used as well.\nThe first row of the data file should contain the column names instead of the actual data. Here is a sample of the expected format.\nCol1,Col2,Col3 \n100,a1,b1 \n200,a2,b2 \n300,a3,b3\nAfter we copy and paste the data above in a file named “mydata.csv” with a text editor, we can read the data with the function read.csv\n\nmydata <- read.csv(\"mydata.csv\")  # read csv file \n\nWarning in read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote, :\nincomplete final line found by readTableHeader on 'mydata.csv'\n\nmydata \n\n  Col1 Col2 Col3\n1  100   a1  b1 \n2  200   a2  b2 \n3  300   a3   b3\n\n\nIn various European locales, as the comma character serves as the decimal point, the function read.csv2 should be used instead. For further detail of the read.csv and read.csv2 functions, please consult the R documentation\n\nhelp(read.csv)\n\n\n\nWorking Directory\nFinally, the code samples above assume the data files are located in the R working directory, which can be found with the function getwd().\nNote that these things can also be set using the RStudio’s GUI.\n\ngetwd()               # get current working directory\n\n[1] \"/Users/rca2t1/Dropbox/Courses/DS/DS5100/DS5100-2023-08-O/repo/notebooks/M10_RBasics\"\n\n\nYou can select a different working directory with the function setwd(), and thus avoid entering the full path of the data files\n\n## setwd(\"<new path>\")   # set working directory\n\nNote that the forward slash should be used as the path separator even on Windows platform\n\n## setwd(\"C:/MyDoc\")"

    "text": "Piping with %>%\nJust a quick note about this odd looking operator that you will start to see.\nOne of the key elements of the Tidyverse is the use of piping, or the ability of to pass the return values of one function to another, with without have to nest functions.\nFor example, instead of something like this:\n\na <- \"Hello\"\nb <- \"World\"\n\nvar1 <- c(a, b)\nvar2 <- paste(var1)\nprint(var2)\n\n[1] \"Hello\" \"World\"\n\n\nOr this:\n\nprint(paste(c(a,b)))\n\n[1] \"Hello\" \"World\"\n\n\nWe can do:\n\nc(a, b) %>%\n  paste() %>%\n  print()\n\n[1] \"Hello\" \"World\"\n\n\nAlthough the last pattern is longer than the preceding, it is much easier to read and write, especially when we are working with several connected functions.\nThis is similar to method chaining in Python, but is more pervasive.\n\nIn Python you can do it with individual objects that return themselves (as it were).\nIn Tidyverse, you can apply it to any two methods so long as it makes sense to pass the output of as the input of another.\nBasically, the output of one function becomes the first argument of the following the %>%.\n\nIt is similar to the pipe operator | in Unix shells.\nBy the way, the operator comes with the magrittr package, which is a central part of the Tidyverse. It is so central, in fact, that packages in the tidyverse load %>% automatically.\nIt provides a set of operators which make your code more readable."

If there are multiple columns that match the criterion (e.g., multiple columns that start with “X”), you’ll need to use these helpers with more precision or utilize other techniques.\nAlso, remember to always refer to the official dplyr documentation as the package continues to evolve and new functionalities might be added over time."

It is a fundamental pattern in data processing.\n\nFirst, we can create a year variable using as.POSIXlt().\n\nchicago <- chicago %>%\n  mutate(year = as.POSIXlt(date)$year + 1900)\nhead(chicago)\n\n  city tmpd dewpoint       date pm25 pm10tmean2 o3tmean2 no2tmean2 pm25detrend\n1 chic 31.5   31.500 1987-01-01   NA   34.00000 4.250000  19.98810          NA\n2 chic 33.0   29.875 1987-01-02   NA         NA 3.304348  23.19099          NA\n3 chic 33.0   27.375 1987-01-03   NA   34.16667 3.333333  23.81548          NA\n4 chic 29.0   28.625 1987-01-04   NA   47.00000 4.375000  30.43452          NA\n5 chic 32.0   28.875 1987-01-05   NA         NA 4.750000  30.33333          NA\n6 chic 40.0   35.125 1987-01-06   NA   48.00000 5.833333  25.77233          NA\n  year\n1 1987\n2 1987\n3 1987\n4 1987\n5 1987\n6 1987\n\n\nNow we can compute summary statistics for each year in the data frame with the summarize() function.\n\nyears <- chicago %>%\n  group_by(year) %>%\n  summarize(pm25 = mean(pm25, na.rm = TRUE), \n          o3 = max(o3tmean2, na.rm = TRUE), \n          no2 = median(no2tmean2, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\nhead(years)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n   year  pm25    o3   no2\n  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1  1987   NaN  63.0  23.5\n2  1988   NaN  61.7  24.5\n3  1989   NaN  59.7  26.1\n4  1990   NaN  52.2  22.6\n5  1991   NaN  63.1  21.4\n6  1992   NaN  50.8  24.8\n\n\nNote in the process, we implicitly created separate data frame that splits the original data frame by year, which is then passed to summarize().\nsummarize() then returns a data frame with columns for year and the annual averages of pm25, o3, and no2.\nIn a slightly more complicated example, we might want to know what are the average levels of ozone (o3) and nitrogen dioxide (no2) within quantiles of pm25.\nA slicker way to do this would be through a regression model, but we can actually do this quickly with group_by() and summarize().\nFirst, we can create a categorical variable of pm25 divided into quantiles.\n\nqq <- quantile(chicago$pm25, seq(0, 1, 0.2), na.rm = TRUE)\nqq\n\n    0%    20%    40%    60%    80%   100% \n 1.700  8.700 12.375 16.700 22.610 61.500 \n\n\nThen can group the data frame by the pm25.quint variable. and compute the mean of o3 and no2 within quantiles of pm25.\n\nchicago %>%\n  mutate(pm25.quint = cut(pm25, qq)) %>%\n  group_by(pm25.quint) %>%\n  summarize(o3 = mean(o3tmean2, na.rm = TRUE), \n          no2 = mean(no2tmean2, na.rm = TRUE),\n          .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  pm25.quint     o3   no2\n  <fct>       <dbl> <dbl>\n1 (1.7,8.7]    21.7  18.0\n2 (8.7,12.4]   20.4  22.1\n3 (12.4,16.7]  20.7  24.4\n4 (16.7,22.6]  19.9  27.3\n5 (22.6,61.5]  20.3  29.6\n6 <NA>         18.8  25.8\n\n\nFrom the table, it seems there isn’t a strong relationship between pm25 and o3, but there appears to be a positive correlation between pm25 and no2.\nMore sophisticated statistical modeling can help to provide precise answers to these questions, but a simple application of dplyr functions can often get you most of the way there.\nHere is another example:\n\nchicago %>%  \n  mutate(month = as.POSIXlt(date)$mon + 1) %>% \n  group_by(month) %>%                              #

For instance, after grouping data, one often uses summarise() to calculate summary statistics for each group. The combination of these functions and their associated helpers allow for a wide range of group-wise data manipulation tasks."

Such a grammar allows us to move beyond named graphics (e.g., the “scatterplot”) and gain insight into the deep structure that underlies statistical graphics (Wickham 2012).\n\nWickham takes this idea and develops it into this:\n\nSource (see also ScienceCraft).\nYou can see that everything starts with data.\nThen data are mapped on aesthetics within geometries.\n\nGeometries are geometric things like points, lines, and bars.\nAesthetics are visual things like position, size, color and shape.\n\nYou can see how the latter are properties of the former.\nAlso note that aesthetics make use of visual channels to signify\n\nSize can mean greater than, which is good for numeric scale but not categories\nColor can signify things like value, e.g. via red : dangerous : : green : safe.\n\nThese are the primary layers.\nThe other layers apply downstream modifications that add more information and style to the graph."

JavaScript is the native programming language of web browsers; the notebook format is executable code that can be integrated into a web application."

    "text": "Outputting\nThere are two ways to set the output of a document:\n\nPermanently, by modifying the YAML header:\ntitle: \"Viridis Demo\"\noutput: html_document\nTransiently, by calling rmarkdown::render() by hand:\n\nrmarkdown::render(\"diamond-sizes.Rmd\", output_format = \"word_document\")\n\nThis is useful if you want to programmatically produce multiple types of output.\n\nRStudio’s knit button renders a file to the first format listed in its output field.\nYou can also do it by code:\nknitr::include_graphics(\"screenshots/rmarkdown-knit.png\")\nEach output format is associated with an R function.\nYou can either write foo or pkg::foo.\nIf you omit pkg, the default is assumed to be rmarkdown.\nIt’s important to know the name of the function that makes the output because that’s where you get help.\nFor example, to figure out what parameters you can set with html_document, look at ?rmarkdown::html_document.\n\nOutput options\nTo override the default parameter values, you need to use an expanded output field. For example, if you wanted to render an html_document with a floating table of contents, you’d use:\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    toc: true\n    toc_float: true\nYou can even render to multiple outputs by supplying a list of formats:\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    toc: true\n    toc_float: true\n  pdf_document: default\nNote the special syntax if you don’t want to override any of the default options."

    "text": "Some basic facts\nProject management is an established field that is used for many activities.\n\nIt is a profession in which you can be certified as a  CPM.\nIt is a field with an established and large body of knowledge – PMBOK.\n\n\nBroadly speaking, it refers to:\n\nA class of rational methods and protocols for organizing the labor of complex activities in order to achieve specific outcomes on time and on budget.\n\nThink NASA’s space program in the 1960s.\nIts history dates to the early 20th century but becomes highly developed in the 1950s and 60s.\n\nIt is closely associated with US military operations, e.g. Gantt Charts and PERT.\nIt was later adapted to software development, due to the complexity and importances of of this kind of work.\n\n\nSource\n\nSoftware is also mission critical\n\n\n\nFrom the beginning, it has been used to support critical operations: weapons systems, air traffic control, financial systems, health care, etc.\n\n\nOnly recently are we seeing the effects of software design – in the form of data products – fail on the basis of bias and other flaws that lead to social harm\n\n\n\nIn the 1960s, the US Department of Defenses study of software problems found that:\n\n\n\n47% of software delivered could not be used, as it usually didn’t meet requirements\n\n\n29% of funded software was never delivered, as it was usually canceled due to cost/schedule overruns\n\n\n19% of software was useful after extensive rework, and it usually cost 36 times more to fix problems after release\n\n\n\nBecause of this, software engineering was developed.\n\n\nBut Software development is hard for many reasons:\n\n\n\nHardware and software are inherently complex.\n\n\nCode is imperfect and error-prone.\n\n\nCode is always an interpretation of specifications that are always underspecified. → DEBUGGING THE SPEC\n\n\n\nUnderspecified in two senses:\n\n\n\nThe inherent inadequacy of language to represent reality.\n\n\n“The map is not the terrain”\n\n\n\n\nThe fact that people don’t know what they want even when they say they do.\n\n\nThat is, reality itself changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe slipperiness of writing code that achieves our goals is the subject of humor:\n\nSource\n\n\nMany paradigms of the software development life cycle (SDLC) have been introduced over the years to address these issues:\n\n\n\nWaterfall\n\n\nSpiral\n\n\nEtc. → See Tutorialspoint on SDLC.\n\n\n\nThe Waterfall Model\n\n\n\n\nWaterfall Methodology\n\n\nSource\n\nWhat they all have in is a faith in the power of planning and engineering to achieve results:\n\n\n\nPlanning as the ability to predict accurately how things will unfold\n\n\nand have people understand and follow rules.\n\n\n\n\nEngineering as the operationalization of labor processes\n\n\nThe ability to treat human behavior as a tractable variable.\n\n\nthe logic of the machine applied to the the organization of labor.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese assumptions are reflected in the relationship between client and developer\n\n\n\nNotice that absence of the client in the design, building, and validation\n\n\n\nThis is partly the result of mitigating the mission creep introduced by the client.\n\n\nThe Iron Triangle\n\nThe Iron Triangle concept shows the effect of changing user requirements on a project.\nIf users want to add something to a project — a new feature, for example — this means that scope has increased.\nTherefore, either tine or resources must expand as well to allow for the change.\n\n\nThe Spiral Method\n\n\nThe Spiral Method recognizes the need to be more iterative, and introduces the client at points in an ongoing cycle. \n\n\n\nPresumably, clients are involved in objective identification and testing …\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\n\nThe methods have the virtue of being rational and comprehensive, defining all the things involved in software development\n\n\n\nBut they are very linear\n\n\n\nEven the Spiral method, which is really a 2D linear process, where phases are features and iterations are observations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary sequence\nS = OI → AE → PD → NPP\n\n\nProcess\nP = S1 → S2 → S3 → … → SN"

    "text": "Backstory\nAgile development is essentially a philosophy developed in response to bureaucratic software development processes.\nIt is an approach that focuses on the realities of software:\n\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\nResponding to change over following a plan\n\nEssentially, it is based on a mistrust of machines, plans, contracts, documents, etc.\nThe Agile Manifesto was written in 2001 after a number of lighter and more flexible approaches were developed in the 1990s.\n\nSCRUM\nXP (Extreme Program) \nEtc.\n\nIt is also a collection of methods and tools:\n\nUser stories\nScrum meetings\nSprints\nTask weighting with cards\nEtc.\n\nAgile is also counter-cultural, like many of the software movements that attended the rise of the web."

    "text": "Principles\nHere are the 12 Principles of Agile SD:\n\nCustomer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software. → The “early and often” of open source development.\nWelcome changing requirements, even in late development.\nDeliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months).\nClose, daily cooperation between business people and developers.\nProjects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted.\nFace-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location).\nWorking software is the primary measure of progress.\nSustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace.\nContinuous attention to technical excellence and good design.\nSimplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.\nBest architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.\nRegularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly.\n\nAs you can see, it’s all about giving teams the freedom and trust to creatively respond to client needs and change."

    "text": "Aside\nAs an aside, it’s worth noting the effect of the Web on these developments.\n\nAgile was spurred by the affordances of the Web and open source software\nAnd for teams to organize organically, without the oversight of governmental bodies or corporations\nInfluenced by the success of Open Source tools like Linux\nConsistent with Git as a tool for organically organizing software development."

    "section": "",
    "text": "User Stories are at the heart of Agile development.\nInstead of eliciting requirements through a formal process, teams ask clients to provide statements in verbal form:\n\nAs a [type of user]\nI want [an action or behavior]\nso that [a benefit/value]\n\nThese are written on index cards.\nThese are accompanied by conversation to clarify the meaning of the sentences.\nThese are then converted into requirements:\n\nFunctional – relating specifically to how the software will work, i.e. function.\nNon-functional (so-called) – relating to the broader purpose and context of usage.\nThese map roughly onto the second and third parts of the user story.\nThey also map on MACHINE and HUMAN.\nThis page shows some examples of stories mapping onto features (so-called acceptance criteria).\n\nThese requirements are then prioritized\n\nUsing MSCW – Must / Should / Can / Won’t\nWithin the context of a scope definition in a charter (not discussed here)\nSee this link for some guidance.\n\nAfter this, requirements are serialized into a rough schedule, grouped into milestones.\nIn executing the “plan,” teams meet regularly in brief, stand-up meetings called scrums.\n\nThese happen daily.\nThese involve the development team.\nStakeholder representatives, such as the product manager, may attend too.\n\nAt regular intervals, clients are introduced to the process\n\nPrototypes, MVPs, etc. are presented.\nFeedback is elicited early and often.\n\nThe process is driven by a communication plan:\n\nFrequency of meeting.\nMode of communication – F2F, Slack, Git.\nTask management tools – Jira, Trello, Smartsheet, etc.\n\nOther artifacts are involved in this process:\n\nThe project charter.\nThe project plan.\nA Kan Ban board."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Each day you will want to update the forked version of the course repo you created for your homework in Module 01.\nHere are the steps to do that:\nFirst, if you have made any changes to the course notebooks and want to keep your changes, make copies of these files in your private repo.\nSecond, enter the command git stash within your local repo to hide the changes you’ve made to the current branch. To learn more about how to use stash, check out the docs on GitHub. For now, we are just using it clean up the repo so when you pull, you don’t run into a conflict between local and remote changes.\nThird, go to the forked version of the course repo on GitHub and issue a Sync Fork command to refresh the content of your repo with the new course content. The screenshot below shows where this command is located on your repo’s web page:\n\nFourth, go back to your local repo and run git pull. You should now have the most recent content from the course repo."
