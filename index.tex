Welcome to DS 5100 Programming for Data Science! In this course, we will
develop skills in Python and R Programming, as well as the command line
and GitHub. The objective of the course is to introduce essential
programming concepts, structures, and techniques from a data science
perspective. You will gain confidence in not only reading code, but
learning what it means to write good quality code. Additionally,
essential and complementary topics are taught, such as testing and
debugging, exception handling, and an introduction to visualization.

This course is designed to teach the programming knowledge and skills
necessary to become an effective data scientist. The focus will be
on~code fluency~-- the ability to both write and read code, as well as
to understand the nature of high quality code. Code fluency encompasses
a variety of skills, from the ability to write functions and classes to
testing and debugging to packaging and visualizing the results of
coding.

Code fluency is important because code is the~primary medium~through
which we represent and express our most basic and complex ideas in data
science. These ideas include everything from the structure of web pages
to the process of back propagation in a neural network. Code is the
language with which we represent data and the models that process and
interpret data, as well as the data products that make use of our data
and the analytical results from it.

This course is specifically focused on your ability to read and write
code in~Python and R. It is not a course in computer science or in data
wrangling or in software development. Each of those elements will
obviously play into our work, but our focus is on the fundamental
knowledge of programming -- the building blocks from which you can build
complex (but not complicated) code to solve real world problems.~

The guiding philosophy of the course is that coding is a~practice~like
many other practices -- such as the ability to speak a non-native human
language, or to play a musical instrument, or to play a sport, or to
perform such as in singing, acting, or dancing. These are all complex
practices that involve higher forms of cognitive representation but are
also~embodied~practices. This means that they have to be practiced,
physically and repetitively, in order for you to be successful at them.
Programming languages are like that.

Put another way,~programming is like cooking, carpentry, and other forms
of material creation. Again, in each case high level cognition is
involved, but so are the hands and eyes, and an appreciation of the
subtle qualities of materials and ingredients is essential to
successfully using them to create effective work -- a sturdy and
beautiful building or a satisfying and exquisite meal.

All of these practices, some of which I am sure each of you has had
experience in, are based on the ideas of imitation and drilling which
develop into generalization and integration and finally into excellence
and mastery of design and execution. Therefore, this course will require
the student to observe principles and imitate examples (though writing)
on the path to generalization and fluency.~

\hypertarget{learning-goals}{%
\section{Learning Goals}\label{learning-goals}}

Upon completion of this course, you are expected to be able to do the
following. In all cases, unless specified, both Python and R are
included. In truth, you'll probably learn more than this. :-)

computation)

In Python and R, use a program API to utilize existing functions
(e.g.~assert statements.)

In R, apply the Tidyverse verbs, such as: select(), filter(), arrange(),
mutate(), summarize()

In R, apply the Tidyverse Pipe operator to aggregate data

Write your own modules of classes in Python

\hypertarget{assessments}{%
\section{Assessments}\label{assessments}}

\hypertarget{homework-assignments}{%
\subsection{Homework Assignments}\label{homework-assignments}}

Homework assignments will given throughout the semester, typically one
for each module.~

You are encouraged to first try to complete the homework by yourself. If
you work with others, be sure you understand all of the work, and that
your final submission is your own work.

When submitting homework assignments, don't forget to write the
assignment title, your name, your UVA computing ID, and date at the top
of each assignment.

Typically, homework assignments that involve Jupyter Notebooks will be
submitted through GradeScope as PDFs. However, in some cases the
assignment will be submitted through Canvas.~ In either case, your
assignment will be listed in the week's module.

\hypertarget{lateness-policy}{%
\subsection{Lateness Policy}\label{lateness-policy}}

Please submit HW assignments on time.

If an issue will prompt late submission, email the TA in advance to
explain the situation.

If the HW is submitted late and it is not an excused lateness, 10\% of
the assignment total points will be deducted per day it is late.

\hypertarget{in-class-activities}{%
\subsection{In-Class Activities}\label{in-class-activities}}

During each class, there will be practice scripts and notebooks made
available to you. These are designed to exemplify the concepts conveyed
in reading and dialog. Although the results of this work are not graded,
you will be graded on your effort to complete them. This will count
toward your participation grade.

\hypertarget{quizzes}{%
\subsection{Quizzes}\label{quizzes}}

There will be several quizzes throughout the semester that will assess
your knowledge of the various topics. Quizzes are based on the topics
and code covered in the readings and activities.

All quizzes are mandatory for all students to take.

Quizzes typically have ten questions and are worth 10 points each.

Although they can be completed in less time, you have one hour to finish
and submit your work.~

The quizzes should be done closed book: please do not consult any
resources including notes, books, the web, devices, or other external
media.

Making up missed quizzes is not advised --- their timing is part of
their value. However, if you know in advance that you will miss any of
the scheduled quizzes, you must make arrangements in advance with the
instructor. At least one week in advance if possible, or as soon as you
are able if an unforeseen event occurs preventing you from taking the
quiz.

\hypertarget{course-project}{%
\subsection{Course Project}\label{course-project}}

The final project will focus on creating a module in Python. This module
will address a data science problem and be sharable on GitHub (in
principle) and installable by others. It will have proper documentation
and a testing file.~

Project deliverables are due on the last day of course. See Collab for
submission details.

More information on the project will be forthcoming.

\hypertarget{spirit-of-the-course}{%
\subsection{Spirit of the Course}\label{spirit-of-the-course}}

Students must attend each class and participate in group work.

For the programming assignments and quizzes, you must submit your own
work.

\hypertarget{submission-of-assignments}{%
\subsection{Submission of Assignments}\label{submission-of-assignments}}

All assignments must be submitted through Canvas or Gradescope by the
specified due dates and times. It is crucial to complete all assigned
work---failure to do so will likely result in failing the class.

\hypertarget{grading}{%
\section{Grading}\label{grading}}

\hypertarget{model}{%
\subsection{Model}\label{model}}

\hypertarget{scale}{%
\subsection{Scale}\label{scale}}

We follow the 3-4-3 model of grading. That is, within each letter range,
the \texttt{+} and \texttt{–} each span 3 values (\([0,1,2]\) and
\([7,8,9]\) respectively), whereas the uninflected grade spans the
middle 4 values (\([3,4,5,6]\)).

Note that it is by convention that we treat \(0\) as standing for the
initial value of a grade span, which leads to the anomaly of \texttt{A}
having \(11\) values, since it includes both \(90\) and \(100\). Past
experience shows that treating \(90\) as a \texttt{B+} is considered an
outrage by students, so we accept the weirdness.

\hypertarget{texts}{%
\section{Texts}\label{texts}}

\hypertarget{core-texts}{%
\subsection{Core Texts}\label{core-texts}}

Many of our readings will draw from these texts. We will try to stick
with some core texts to provide continuity. These will often be
supplemented by shorter sources of information drawn from the web.

\hypertarget{resources}{%
\section{Resources}\label{resources}}

Students have three choices for participating in coding exercises and
completing coding assignments in the course:

Rivanna, UVA's High Performance Computing Cluster. This may be access
through the web or by SSH (don't worry if you don't know what that means
yet). More information about this resource may be found here.

CEDS, the Computational Environment for Data Science. This is a
web-hosted and Windows-based virtual environment. You can access the
site here. Here are step-by-step instructions for how to access this
service.

Your own computer. Please note that if you choose this option it will be
harder to trouble-shoot any system level problems t hat may arise.

\hypertarget{academic-integrity}{%
\section{Academic Integrity}\label{academic-integrity}}

The School of Data Science relies upon and cherishes its community of
trust. We firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University's Honor
principle that students will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor shall they
tolerate those who do. We recognize that even one honor infraction can
destroy an exemplary reputation that has taken years to build. Acting in
a manner consistent with the principles of honor will benefit every
member of the community both while enrolled in the School of Data
Science and in the future.

Students are expected to be familiar with~the university honor code,
including the section on academic fraud.

Each assignment will describe allowed collaborations, and deviations
from these will be considered Honor violations. If you have questions on
what is allowable, ask! Unless otherwise noted, exams and individual
assignments will be considered pledged that you have neither given nor
received help. (Among other things, this means that you are not allowed
to describe problems on an exam to a student who has not taken it yet.
You are not allowed to show exam papers to another student or view
another student's exam papers while working on an exam.) Sending,
receiving or otherwise copying electronic files that are part of course
assignments are not allowed collaborations (except for those explicitly
allowed in assignment instructions).~

Assignments or exams where honor infractions or prohibited
collaborations occur will receive a zero grade for that entire
assignment or exam. Such infractions will also be submitted to the Honor
Committee if that is appropriate. Students who have had prohibited
collaborations may not be allowed to work with partners on remaining
homework assignments.~

If you have been identified as a Student Disability Access Center (SDAC)
student, please let the Center know you are taking this class. If you
suspect you should be an SDAC student, please schedule an appointment
with them for an evaluation. I happily and discretely provide the
recommended accommodations for those students identified by the SDAC.
Please contact your instructor one week before an exam so we can make
appropriate accommodations.
Website:~https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/sdac~

If you are affected by a situation that falls within issues addressed by
the SDAC and the instructor and staff are not informed about this in
advance, this prevents us from helping during the semester, and it is
unfair to request special considerations at the end of the term or a?er
work is completed. So we request you inform the instructor as early in
the term as possible your circumstances. If you have other special
circumstances (athletics, other university-related activities, etc.)
please contact your instructor and/or TA as soon as you know these may
affect you in class.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

A useful infrastructural resource for this course is Rivanna, UVA's
high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. Each student has an account on
Rivanna and access to resources there based on participation in this
course. We will use Rivanna in our class for both Python and R.~

This page describes some of the tools available for your use in this
course. For information about Rivanna, see~this introduction. Resources
for getting help, including a knowledge base and ticket system, are
found at~\href{http://www.rc.virginia.edu/support/}{the Support Option's
Page} on UVA's Research Computing website.

You may need to use VPN to access Rivanna from an off-grounds location.
To install VPN on your computer, go to the~ITS VPN page~for
instructions. Note that you should connect to ``UVA Anywhere,'' not to
any of the higher security options. Course Allocation

This course has been allocated compute and space resources on Rivanna.
The names of the resources are given below. The allocation ID needs to
be entered to access certain tools. The storage path is accessible to
you on the remote server.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Allocation ID: \texttt{msds\_ds5100}
\item
  Storage path: \texttt{/project/MSDS\_DS5100}~ (Don't use unless
  directed to.)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{tools}{%
\section{Tools~}\label{tools}}

UVA Research Computing provides you with a suite of tools to access
Rivanna. These tools are accessible through the menu on the
UVA~OpenOnDemand Dashboard page. Below are some brief descriptions of
the tools.

\textbf{File Explorer}. A web-based GUI to access the file system of the
remote server. Can be used to create, move, and delete directories and
files, and to edit the contents of files (see Editor). You can also
upload and download files through this interface. The File Explorer is
useful to view your remote content and manage files and directories
without having to use the command line. Note that not all operations can
be performed through this interface.

Find under ``Files'' in the menu.~

\textbf{Editor}. A web-based text editor launched from the File Explorer
to view and edit text files on the remote server.~ Although not as
sophisticated as VS Code (below), this is very useful for editing data
and code files without having to use a command line editor. One
advantage over VS Code is that it does not need to be launched -- which
means it does not time out like the Interactive Apps listed below.

The Editor is launched from the File Explorer.

\textbf{SSH Shell Access (Terminal)}.~Access to the command line of the
remote server.~ Use this to open a terminal window to perform Linux
commands directly.~ Note that It is necessary to use a terminal to
install and run certain programs on the remote server.

Find under ``Clusters'' in the menu.~

You can also access the remote command line via SSH on your local
computer. Just enter the following on the command line of either a PC or
Mac:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ssh} \AttributeTok{{-}Y} \OperatorTok{\textless{}}\NormalTok{userid}\OperatorTok{\textgreater{}}\NormalTok{@hpc.rivanna.virginia.edu}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Replace~\texttt{\textless{}userid\textgreater{}}~with your UVA Net ID,
e.g.~\texttt{abc2x}.~

Be suer to be running VPN if you are accessing Rivanna from an
off-grounds location.

\hypertarget{interactive-apps}{%
\section{Interactive Apps}\label{interactive-apps}}

These tools must be launched by specifying a set of parameters,
including the allocation you are using. They are also timed and will
close when time is up. Be sure to give yourself enough time when
launching these, and to be aware of how much time you have when working.

Note also that you should allocate the fewest resources necessary to do
the work you plan to do. This saves resources on the remote host, but
also allows your app to launch more quickly. If you ask for an excessive
amount of resources, you may wait a long time (e.g.~hours) to have your
app launched.

\textbf{Desktop}.~Access to a GUI desktop to the remote server. This
provides a access to various applications on the server, including a web
browser, a file explorer, and terminal windows.~ Using this is not
necessary if you can get by with the tools listed above.

Find under ``Interactive Apps \textgreater{} Desktop'' in the menu.

\textbf{VS Code}. Access to Visual Studio Code on the remote server.
This is a fully functional instance of the IDE.

Find under ``Interactive Apps \textgreater{} Code Server'' in the menu.

\textbf{Jupyter}.~Access to Jupyter Lab on the remote server. Find under
``Interactive Apps \textgreater{} Jupyter Lab'' in the menu.

\textbf{RStudio}. Access to Jupyter Lab on the remote server.

Find under ``Interactive Apps \textgreater{} RStudio Server'' in the
menu.

\hypertarget{using-unix}{%
\chapter{Using Unix}\label{using-unix}}

\hypertarget{introduction-1}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}}

The Unix family of operating systems provide users with~a command line
interface~(CLI) to execute commands and get things done. They also,
typically provide GUIs but we won't go into those here.

The Unix family includes all varieties of Linux and the Mac OS (which is
based on FreeBSD).

The command line that you actually interact with -- the set of commands
available to you -- is called a~shell, and there are several shells that
you can run on your system. The most typical shell in use today is
called~bash~which stands for Bourne Again Shell, since it is an improved
version of~bsh~(The Bourne Shell). New versions of MacOS use the Z shell
(zsh). The commands in these two shells are mostly similar, but there
are subtle differences.

Windows has shells too for its command line interface. The default shell
is DOS, but is also has~PowerShell~ as an advanced (and very capable)
option.

\hypertarget{basic-commands}{%
\section{Basic Commands}\label{basic-commands}}

In this course, you don't need to know very many Unix shell commands,
but you should be~comfortable~working from the command line to perform
basic tasks. This is because~some things can only be performed from the
command line, such as installing some essential software. Here is a list
of basic commands.

Navigating filesystems and managing directories:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{cd} -- change directory
\item
  \texttt{pwd} -- show the current directory
\item
  \texttt{ln} -- make links and symlinks to files and directories
\item
  \texttt{mkdir} -- make new directory
\item
  \texttt{rmdir} -- remove directories in Unix
\end{itemize}

Navigating filesystem and managing files and access permissions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{ls} -- list files and directories
\item
  \texttt{cp} -- copy files (work in progress)
\item
  \texttt{rm} -- remove files and directories (work in progress)
\item
  \texttt{mv} -- rename or move files and directories to another
  location
\item
  \texttt{chmod} -- change file/directory access permissions
\item
  \texttt{chown} -- change file/directory ownership
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{text-file-commands}{%
\section{Text file commands}\label{text-file-commands}}

Most of important configuration in Unix is in plain text files, these
commands will let you quickly inspect files or view logs:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{cat} -- concatenate files and show contents to the standard
  output
\item
  \texttt{more} -- basic pagination when viewing text files or parsing
  Unix commands output
\item
  \texttt{less} -- an improved pagination tool for viewing text files
  (better than more command)
\item
  \texttt{head} -- show the first 10 lines of text file (you can specify
  any number of lines)
\item
  \texttt{tail} -- show the last 10 lines of text file (any number can
  be specified)
\item
  \texttt{grep} -- search for patterns in text files
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{miscellaneous}{%
\section{Miscellaneous}\label{miscellaneous}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{clear} -- clear screen
\item
  \texttt{history} -- show history of previous commands
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{command-line-cool}{%
\section{Command Line Cool}\label{command-line-cool}}

Although we will not be using the command line to this degree, you
should know that it is a powerful environment for doing data science
work. The book~\href{https://datascienceatthecommandline.com/2e/}{Data
Science from the Command Line}~makes the case for using the command line
to perform many tasks that we often perform with more resource intensive
(i.e.~bloated) tools such as Python and R.~ At some point in your early
DS career, you may want to look at this. The book itself is also a great
introduction to data science!

\includegraphics{topics/../media/dsatcl-cover-small.png}

One last thing -- for fun you may want to read Neal
Stephenson's~\href{http://project.cyberpunk.ru/lib/in_the_beginning_was_the_command_line/}{``In
the Beginning Was The Command Line''}, a kind of cyberpunk history of
the topic. Stephenson, by the way, is the author who coined the term
``metaverse'' in the novel~\emph{Snowcrash}.

  This method will allow you to interact with your repos hosted on
  GitHub without having to enter your login credentials each time.
\item
  You will create an SSH key on your local machine. By ``local
  machine,'' we mean the machine where you will be working and pulling
  to, e.g your laptop or Rivanna. In other words, it's local relative to
  GitHub.
\item
  SSH keys have a public and private component. These are hash strings
  that are stored in files. Both will be generated on your machine.
\item
  You will copy and paste the generate public key to your GitHub
  account.
\item
  Going forward, you will clone from your account using the SSH
  protocol.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{steps}{%
\section{Steps}\label{steps}}

\hypertarget{part-a}{%
\subsection{Part A}\label{part-a}}

\textbf{On your local machine}

Get to the command line (i.e.~the shell).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  On a Mac, open Terminal.
\item
  If you are on Windows and you have admin rights, first install
  \texttt{git-bash}. Otherwise follow
  \href{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement}{this
  tutorial from Microsoft}.
\item
  On
  \href{https://rivanna-portal.hpc.virginia.edu/pun/sys/shell/ssh/rivanna.hpc.virginia.edu}{Rivanna},
  either connect via SSH or use Rivanna Shell Access (under Clusters).
\end{enumerate}

Move into your root directory and enter \texttt{cd}.

Generate the key.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Enter:
  \texttt{ssh-keygen\ -t\ ed25519\ -C\ "your\_email\_id@example.com"},
  using your email address.
\item
  Be sure to use the email address associated with your GitHub account
  in the above command.
\end{enumerate}

At the prompt, type in a secure passphrase.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You don't have to do this, but it is advised.
\item
  Create a memorable sentence.
\item
  A good passphrase should have at least 15, preferably 20 characters
  and be difficult to guess. It should contain upper case letters, lower
  case letters, digits, and preferably at least one punctuation
  character.
\end{itemize}

Add the key to \texttt{ssh-agent}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Enter: \texttt{eval\ "\$(ssh-agent\ -s)"}
\item
  Enter: \texttt{ssh-add\ \textasciitilde{}/.ssh/id\_ed25519}
\end{enumerate}

If you're using macOS Sierra 10.12.2 or later, you will need to modify
your \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/.ssh/config} file to automatically load
keys into the ssh-agent and store passphrases in your keychain. Follow
the instructions
\href{https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=mac\#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent}{here}
(at step 2).

\hypertarget{part-b}{%
\subsection{Part B}\label{part-b}}

\textbf{On your GitHub account}

Get the public key that was just generated.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Enter: \texttt{more\ \textasciitilde{}/.ssh/id\_ed25519.pub}
\item
  Copy the result to your clipboard (e.g.~by blocking off the line and
  entering Ctrl-C).
\item
  The key should begin \texttt{ssh-ed25519} and end with the email
  address you used in generating the key. In between it will have a long
  string of alphanumeric characters.
\end{enumerate}

On GitHub, go to your account settings and select ``SSH and GPG Keys''
from the side menu.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A link to your account settings can be found in the drop-down list
  produced by clicking on your user icon in the upper right of the
  website.
\end{itemize}

Under ``SSH keys,'' press the ``New SSH Key'' button.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Add a brief title describing the context of the key, i.e.~the local
  machine where it was generated, e.g.~Rivanna.
\item
  Choose ``Authentication Key'' as the Key type.
\item
  Paste the key into the Key text area.
\item
  Submit the form by pressing ``Add SSH key.''
\end{enumerate}

You are now good to go. Whenever you clone a site from your GitHub
account, choose the SSH link.

\hypertarget{information-sources}{%

Git and GitHub are two tools that work together, but it is important to
understand what each does and how they are different to each other.

Here are some basic things to know:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Git is a stand-alone version control system that runs on a variety of
  platforms, including Linux, MacOS, and Windows.
\item
  GitHub is a company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting
  service that makes it easy to use Git for version control,
  collaboration, and sharing code. This service is offered through a
  website.
\item
  There are other Git hosting services out there, including GitLab, and
  open source tool that can be installed on a local server.
\item
  GitHub builds on top of Git and adds some functionality to it, while
  Git can interact with GitHub through actions like cloning, pushing,
  and pulling. However, Git does not require GitHub to function.
\item
  Git does not have a fork command. GitHub (and other hosting services
  such as GitLab) have added this command as a convenient way to copy
  repositories.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Fork} & Forking a repo makes a copy of someone else's repo in
your GitHub account, which you can now modify. Note: Forking does not
have to be performed if you are not interested in altering the code. You
can clone it directlty. & This is done through GitHub's web interface by
clicking on the Fork button. \\
\textbf{Clone} & Cloning the repo to a workspace to which you have
access, whether a local machine or a remote resource (e.g.~Rivanna). &
\texttt{git\ clone\ \textless{}repo\textgreater{}} \\
\textbf{Add} & Creating or editing a file locally and then adding it to
the list of files git will keep track of. &
\texttt{git\ add\ \textless{}filename\textgreater{}}Note that you may
use wildcards here, e.g.~*, to add more than one file at a time. \\
\textbf{Commit} & Committing the changes made to the file by adding them
to the repo's database of changes. This is accompanied by a brief,
descriptive message of the changes made. &
\texttt{git\ commit\ -m\ "What\ you\ did"} \\
\textbf{Push} & Pushing the changes to the remote repo that you cloned
from. This uploads both the files and the database changes to the repo.
& \texttt{git\ push} \\
\textbf{Pull} & Pulling, i.e.~downloading, any changes that have been
made to the remote repo to your local repo. This usually happens if you
are working in teams on the same project. & \texttt{git\ pull} \\
\textbf{Pull Request} & This is a request made to the owner of the
original repo to pull in the changes you've made to your forked copy. &
This is done through GitHub's web interface. Read the
\href{https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests}{docs}.~\includegraphics{topics/../media/pull-request-button.jpg} \\
\textbf{Fetch Upstream} & This refreshes the content of your forked repo
with the content from the original repo. & This is done through GitHub's
web interface. Read the

In this diagram, the dashed lines refer to actions performed only once
for a give repo. Forking and cloning are done to acquire a repo, while
fetch upstream (aka sync fork) and pull requests on the GitHub server,
and pull/push on your local machine, are done repeatedly as you develop
and share code.

Note also that the here ``Remote workstation'' may be confusing; it
means remote relative to your laptop, e.g.~Rivanna, which we sometimes
call local relative to the GitHub repo. In any case, note that these two
copies of the same repo do not communicate with each other directly, but
rather through their common relationship with the GitHub hosted instance
of the repo.

After reading the previous documents on
\protect\hyperlink{about-rivanna}{Rivanna} and
\protect\hyperlink{using-unix}{Unix}, try to complete this activity
before class.

To get started, go to
\href{https://rivanna-portal.hpc.virginia.edu/pun/sys/dashboard}{OpenOnDemand
Dashboard page} and from the main menu select Clusters → Rivanna Shell
Access.

This should open a terminal to what is called the ``shell'' of the
operating system.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{modules/m01/../../media/107383064.png}

\caption{Screenshot of Rivanna shell}

\end{figure}

Rivanna uses Linux, a member of the Unix family of operating systems.
Many cloud resources use Linux.

Understanding how to do work from the command line on such systems is an
essential skill of the data scientist.

If you have never used the command line, have no fear! Just enter the
commands exactly as shown and ask questions in the Teams chat if you are
stuck.

\textbf{Now, create a directory for your course and this course by
entering the following commands:}

\begin{verbatim}
cd Documents 
mdkir MSDS 
cd MSDS 
mkdir DS5100 
cd DS5100
\end{verbatim}

If the \texttt{Documents} directory does not exist, create that first
using the mkdir command.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{cd} means ``change directory,'' and is a basic Unix command.
\item
  \texttt{mkdir} means ``make directory.'' It's also a basic Unix
  command.
\end{itemize}

Note that you can use the tab key to complete path and command names as
you type.

You don't have to, but it would be a good idea to create subdirectories
for any of your courses that use Rivanna.

More information about Unix shell commands can be found the document

You also should be able check off the following items:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Understand the difference between Git and GitHub.
\item
  Understand the purpose of Git and Github for data science work.
\item
  Ensure Git is installed on your computer.
\item
  Understand how to find a repository on GitHub.
\end{itemize}

Let's apply and extend this knowledge now with our course repo.

Be sure you are inside the course directory we created earlier.

Also, we assume you have already created a GitHub account. å
\textbf{\emph{Fork} the course GitHub hosted repository (``repo'') to
your GitHub account.}

Go to https://github.com/ontoligent/DS5100-2023-07-R in your web
browser.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, toprule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, opacityback=0, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, bottomtitle=1mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, leftrule=.75mm, left=2mm, colback=white, breakable]

This is the course repo --- all of the course notebooks and other code
will be available here.~Each week, you will access your course materials
here.

\end{tcolorbox}

Click on the Fork icon in the upper right and follow the prompts to
finish the process.

You should end up at the web page of your newly forked repo.

You will now have a copy of the repo in your GitHub account.

\textbf{\emph{Clone} the forked repo for this course inside of your
course directory on Rivanna.}

Find the green Code button and click on it. You should see something
like this:

\includegraphics{modules/m01/../../media/git-clone.jpg}

Make sure you have selected the SSH option.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colframe=quarto-callout-important-color-frame, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-important-color}{\faExclamation}\hspace{0.5em}{Important}, toprule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, opacityback=0, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-important-color!10!white, bottomtitle=1mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, leftrule=.75mm, left=2mm, colback=white, breakable]

Note: This requires that you have SSH set up.

\end{tcolorbox}

Then click on the copy icon and paste the value into the following
command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ clone https://github.com:}\OperatorTok{\textless{}}\NormalTok{github\_user\_name}\OperatorTok{\textgreater{}}\NormalTok{/DS5100{-}2023{-}07{-}R.git}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colframe=quarto-callout-important-color-frame, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-important-color}{\faExclamation}\hspace{0.5em}{Important}, toprule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, opacityback=0, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-important-color!10!white, bottomtitle=1mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, leftrule=.75mm, left=2mm, colback=white, breakable]

Be sure to clone the repo from \emph{your} GitHub account, replacing
\texttt{\textless{}github\_user\_name\textgreater{}} with your GitHub
user name. Do not just cut-and-paste the line above!

\end{tcolorbox}

You now have a copy the course repo to your account on Rivanna.

This will be the directory you created in your pre-class activities
under Documents/.

\textbf{\emph{Create} a new file in your newly cloned repo.}

Go to your command line window on Rivanna.

Use \texttt{cd} to move into the directory just created by the clone
operation.

Move into the directory \texttt{lessons/M01\_GettingStarted/hello}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colframe=quarto-callout-important-color-frame, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-important-color}{\faExclamation}\hspace{0.5em}{Important}, toprule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, opacityback=0, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-important-color!10!white, bottomtitle=1mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, leftrule=.75mm, left=2mm, colback=white, breakable]

Make sure you are in this directory before proceeding.

\end{tcolorbox}

If you get lost -- for example if you moved around the file system
before this step -- you can cd to the absolute path:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ \textasciitilde{}/Documents/MSDS/DS5100/DS5100{-}2023{-}07{-}R/lessons/M01\_GettingStarted/hello }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that the tilde sign \texttt{\textasciitilde{}} stands for the path
to your home directory.

Using the file editor on Rivanna, create and save new file called
\texttt{\textless{}userid\textgreater{}\_hello.txt}, replacing
\texttt{\textless{}userid\textgreater{}} with your actual user ID,
e.g.~\texttt{rca2t\_hello.txt}.

In the file, introduce yourself by answering the question: What is the
most recent film you watched and enjoyed?

Save the file.

\textbf{\emph{Add} and \emph{commit} the changes you made.}

Now do the following:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ add }\OperatorTok{\textless{}}\NormalTok{userid}\OperatorTok{\textgreater{}}\NormalTok{\_hello.txt}
\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ commit }\AttributeTok{{-}m} \StringTok{"Created file for class"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{\emph{Push} your new file to the repo on GitHub.}

Since you have SSH set up, you can issue the following command without
having to enter a password:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ push}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{Create a \emph{Pull Request}}

Finally, make a pull request to have your file added to the original
site. To do this, follow these steps:

Click on the ``Pull requests'' menu item (see image below) on the web
page for your repo.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{modules/m01/../../media/pull-request-button.jpg}

}

\caption{Image of pull request button on GitHub}

\end{figure}

Click on the green ``New pull request'' button.

Click on the green ``Create pull request'' button.

Give the request the title ``In-class activity'' and then press the
green ``Create pull request'' button at the bottom of the form.

Now the ball is in the instructor's court to merge the request with the
original. If you put your file in the right place and named it properly,
it will be merged.

\hypertarget{going-forward}{%
\section{Going Forward}\label{going-forward}}

During the semester, you will not be making pull requests to submit your
work. We do it here to demonstrate the concept since it is so basic to
working with GitHub in the real world.

Instead of making pull requests, you will be using a separate repository
for your work So, you will be working with two repositories going
forard:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{The Course Repo}, which is where you will get course
  materials.
\item
  \textbf{Your Assessments Repo}, which is where you will be your
  finished work as assigned.

\chapter{Data and Code}\label{data-and-code}}

An important principle for writing effective and intelligible code is
that code should be simple --- to quote Einstein, as simple as possible
but no simpler.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A contributing factor to code simplicity is how it is related to the
  data it is designed to process.
\item
  This relationship depends largely on how the data are structured.
\item
  A program is always written with data in mind --- what kind of data it
  is and how it is structured.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{simplicity-of-code-follows-from-the-structure-of-data}{%
\section{Simplicity of code follows from the structure of
data}\label{simplicity-of-code-follows-from-the-structure-of-data}}

There is a view among programmers which, although not orthodoxy, is
commonplace.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It is the idea that the complexity of a program --- its algorithms ---
  is a function of the quality of the data structure it processes.
\item
  If a data structure is not well designed, algorithms may be
  excessively complex and hard to understand.
\item
  However if a data structure is well designed, the algorithms that
  process them are more robust and intelligible.
\end{itemize}

Consider these quotes cited in an essay on
\href{https://medium.com/webdevops/data-structures-548cbea9c520}{Data
Structures}. by Igor Budasov, reproduced here:

Here's \href{https://lwn.net/Articles/193245/}{a quote from Linus
Torvalds in 2006}:

\begin{quote}
I'm a huge proponent of designing your code around the data, rather than
the other way around, and I think it's one of the reasons git has been
fairly successful . . . I will, in fact, claim that the difference
between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his
{[}sic{]} code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers
worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and
their relationships.
\end{quote}

Which sounds a lot like
\href{http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html}{Eric
Raymond's ``Rule of Representation'' from 2003}:

\begin{quote}
Fold knowledge into data, so program logic can be stupid and robust.
\end{quote}

Which was just his summary of ideas like
\href{http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/pikestyle}{this one from Rob Pike
in 1989}:

\begin{quote}
Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized
things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data
structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.
\end{quote}

Which cites
\href{https://archive.org/stream/mythicalmanmonth00fred/mythicalmanmonth00fred_djvu.txt}{Fred
Brooks from 1975}:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Representation is the Essence of Programming}\\
\strut \\
Beyond craftsmanship lies invention, and it is here that lean, spare,
fast programs are born. Almost always these are the result of strategic
breakthrough rather than tactical cleverness. Sometimes the strategic
breakthrough will be a new algorithm, such as the Cooley-Tukey Fast
Fourier Transform or the substitution of an n log n sort for an n 2 set
of comparisons.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Much more often, strategic breakthrough will come from redoing
the representation of the data or tables.} This is where the heart of
your program lies. Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and
I shall be continued to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won't
usually need your flowcharts; they'll be obvious.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{python-object-types}{%
\chapter{Python Object Types}\label{python-object-types}}

Python is organized into a hierarchy of object types. Sometimes, these
are just call \textbf{types}.

Objects are the basic unit out of which the language is constructed.

We'll learn about objects later -- what they are and how to create your
own -- but for now just understand that they have two main things
associated with them:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  First, they can contain \textbf{data}.
\item
  Second, they can have \textbf{behaviors}, frequently in relation to
  the data they contain.
\end{itemize}

Data types and data structures are kinds of objects.

\hypertarget{the-python-interactive-shell}{%
\section{The Python Interactive
Shell}\label{the-python-interactive-shell}}

Log onto the Rivanna shell and move into in the course directory you
created for this class.

From the command line, enter python

You should get the Python Shell:

\includegraphics{modules/m02/../../media/python-prompt.png}

This is also called the Python standard REPL, which stands for
``Read-Eval-Print Loop''.

Make sure you see that you are using version 3 of Python.

If you see Python 2, exit the shell by entering \texttt{quit()} and try
again by entering python3 at the command line.

At the \texttt{\textgreater{}\textgreater{}\textgreater{}} prompt type
\texttt{print("Hello,\ World!")} and press return.

If you've never used Python, you've just completed an important ritual.
If you have used Python, well, you did it again :-)

To exit the Python Shell, enter \texttt{quit()} or \texttt{exit()} and
hit return.

\hypertarget{python-files}{%
\section{Python Files}\label{python-files}}

Now create a file called \texttt{hello.py} using the command line editor
\texttt{nano}.

Then run it from the command line by directly invoking the Python
interpreter python.

\hypertarget{activity-jupyter-lab}{%
\chapter{Activity: Jupyter Lab}\label{activity-jupyter-lab}}

Now that we have run Python on Rivanna from the command line, let's try
it using a Jupyter Notebook.

Go the OnDemand site to access Rivanna. As a reminder, the URL is
\url{https://rivanna-portal.hpc.virginia.edu/}.

From the Interactive Apps menu, select JupyterLab and fill out the form
to initiate a new session.

Remember to select just the resources needed and to enter our course
allocations (\texttt{msds\_ds5100}).

Once the session is ready, launch the notebook.

Once you are in the notebook, use file system tab on the left to get to
the directory of your personal assessments repo. Remember, you created
two repos for this class -- one for course content from the instructor,
and one for your own course work. Use the latter for this exercise.

In a code cell in the notebook, enter the code to print
\texttt{"Hello,\ World!"}, and run the cell.

Save your notebook as \texttt{hello-world.ipynb}.

\hypertarget{nb-data-types-operators-and-expressions}{%
\chapter{NB: Data Types, Operators, and
Expressions}\label{nb-data-types-operators-and-expressions}}

We declare a number of variables with different value types.

By `type' we mean object type.

Data types and data structures are both types of object.

Data types are created by the way they are written or as keywords
\ldots{}

Here is a series of literal values (called \textbf{literals}):

\textbf{Integers}

\hypertarget{assignment}{%
\chapter{Assignment}\label{assignment}}

Data are assigned to \textbf{variables} using the assignment
\textbf{operator} \texttt{=}.

The variable is always on the \textbf{left}, the value assigned to it on
the \textbf{right}.

This is not the same as mathemtical equality.

Variables are assigned types \textbf{dynamically}.

This is in contrast to static typing, where you have define variables by
asserting what kind of data values they can hold.

Python figures out what type of data is being set to the variable and
implicitly stores that info.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{integerEx }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{8}

operators are \textbf{verbs}.

In effect, they are \textbf{elementary functions} that are expressed in
sequential syntax.

\texttt{a\ +\ b} could have been expressed as \texttt{add(a,\ b)}.

Basically, \textbf{each data type is associated with a set of operators}
that allow you to manipulate the data in way that makes sense for its
type. Numeric data types are subject to mathematical operations,
booleans to logical ones, and so forth.

There are also \textbf{operations appropriate to structures}. For
example, list-like things have membership.

The relationship between types and operators is a microcosm of the
relationship betweed data structures and algorithms. \textbf{Data
structures imply algorithms and algorithms assume data structures.}

The w3schools site has
\href{https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp}{a good
summary}.

Here are some you may not have seen.

\hypertarget{identity-is}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Identity

The \texttt{is} keyword is used to test if two variables refer to the
same object.

The test returns \texttt{True} if the two objects are the same object.

The test returns False if they are not the same object, even if the two
objects are 100\% equal.

Use the \texttt{==} operator to test if two variables are equal.

\hypertarget{unary-operators}{%
\chapter{Unary Operators}\label{unary-operators}}

Python offers a short-cut for most operators. When updating a variable
with an operation to that variable, such as:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_var }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ my\_var }\OperatorTok{+} \DecValTok{1}  \CommentTok{\# Incrementing}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can do this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_var }\OperatorTok{+=} \DecValTok{1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Python supports many operators this way. Here are some:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{a }\OperatorTok{{-}=}\NormalTok{ a}
\NormalTok{a \textbackslash{}}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ a}
\NormalTok{a \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ a}
\NormalTok{a }\OperatorTok{\%=}\NormalTok{ a}
\NormalTok{a }\OperatorTok{*=}\NormalTok{ a}
\NormalTok{a }\OperatorTok{**=}\NormalTok{ a}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{expressions}{%
\chapter{Expressions}\label{expressions}}

Variables, literal values, and operators are the building blocks of
ebxpressions.

For example, the following combines three operators and four variables:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{1} \OperatorTok{+} \DecValTok{2} \OperatorTok{*} \DecValTok{3} \OperatorTok{/} \DecValTok{2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
4.0
\end{verbatim}

Python employs \textbf{operator precedence} when evaluating expressions:

\begin{verbatim}
P – Parentheses
E – Exponentiation
M – Multiplication
D – Division
A – Addition
S – Subtraction
\end{verbatim}

You can use parentheses to group them to force the order of operations
you want:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1} \OperatorTok{+} \DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{ (}\DecValTok{3} \OperatorTok{/} \DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
4.5
\end{verbatim}

Variables and literal values can be combined:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{y }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{5}
\NormalTok{m }\OperatorTok{=} \FloatTok{2.5}
\NormalTok{b }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{10}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{y }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ m }\OperatorTok{*} \DecValTok{10} \OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{ b}
\NormalTok{y}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
35.0
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{y }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ m }\OperatorTok{*} \DecValTok{5} \OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{ b}
\NormalTok{y}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
22.5
\end{verbatim}

Expresssion can be very complex.

Expressions evaluate to a value, just as single variables do.

Therefore, they can be put anywhere a value is accepted.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{int}\NormalTok{((y }\OperatorTok{+} \DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{**} \DecValTok{8}\NormalTok{)}

Strings are signified by quotes.

Single and double quotes are identical in function.

They must be ``straight quotes'' though -- cutting and pasting from a

Python uses a print function.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"This is a simple print statement"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Python supports special ``escape characters'' in strings that produce
effects when printed.

\begin{verbatim}
\\     Backslash (\)
\'     Single quote (')
\"     Double quote (")
\n     ASCII Linefeed, aka new line
\end{verbatim}

Note that these are not unique to Python. They are part of almost all
languages.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Tab character ( \textbackslash{}t )}
\BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Hello,}\CharTok{\textbackslash{}t}\StringTok{World! (With a tab character)"}\NormalTok{)}

\hypertarget{nb-structures}{%
\chapter{NB: Structures}\label{nb-structures}}

In contrast to primitive data types, data structures organize types into
structures that have certain properties, such as \textbf{order},
\textbf{mutability}, and \textbf{addressing scheme}, e.g.~by index.

A list is an ordered sequence of items.

Each element of a list is associated with an integer that represents the
order in which the element appears.

Lists are indexed with \textbf{brackets} \texttt{{[}{]}}.

List elements are accessed by providing their order number in the
brackets.

Lists are \textbf{mutable}, meaning you can modify them after they have
been created.

They can contain mixed types.

\hypertarget{constructing}{%

\hypertarget{indexing-1}{%

\textbf{Zero-based indexing}

Python uses xzero-based indexing, which means for a collection
\texttt{mylist}

\texttt{mylist{[}0{]}} references the first element\\
\texttt{mylist{[}1{]}} references the second element, etc

For any iterable object of length \emph{N}:\\
\texttt{mylist{[}:n{]}} will return the first \emph{n} elements from
index \emph{0} to \emph{n-1}\\
\texttt{mylist{[}-n:{]}} will return the last \emph{n} elements from
index \emph{N-n} to \emph{N-1}

But they are constructed used braces \texttt{\{\}}.

Key names are unique. If you re-use a key, you overwrite its value.

Keys don't have to be strings -- they can be numbers or tuples or

You can't change a tuple once it's created.

A tuple can contain any number of elements of any datatype.

A \texttt{set} is an unordered collection of unique objects.

They are subject to set operations.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{peanuts}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note the set is deduped

Since sets are unordered, they don't have an index. This will break:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{peanuts[}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{Check if a value is in the set using \texttt{in}}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\textquotesingle{}snoopy\textquotesingle{}} \KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ peanuts}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Combine two sets

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Shaded}

This fails:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{set1 }\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{ set2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This succeeds:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{set1.union(set2)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Get the set intersection

\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{set1.intersection(set2)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{ranges}{%
\chapter{Ranges}\label{ranges}}

A range is a sequence of integers, from \texttt{start} to \texttt{stop}
by \texttt{step}. - The \texttt{start} point is zero by default.\\
- The \texttt{step} is one by default.\\
- The \texttt{stop} point is NOT included.

Ranges can be assigned to a variable.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{rng }\OperatorTok{=} \BuiltInTok{range}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

More often, ranges are used in iterations, which we will cover later.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ rn }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ rng:}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(rn)}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{collections-and-defaultdict}{%
\chapter{\texorpdfstring{Collections and

Very often you will want to build a dictionary from some data source,
and add keys as they appear. The default \texttt{dict} type in Python,
however, requires that the key exists before you can mutate it. The
\texttt{defaultdict} type in the \texttt{collections} module solves this
problem. Here's an example.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{source\_data }\OperatorTok{=} \StringTok{"""}
\StringTok{Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. }
\StringTok{Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\textquotesingle{}s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, }
\StringTok{when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type }
\StringTok{specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap }
\StringTok{into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was }
\StringTok{popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing }
\StringTok{Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software }

\section{Introducing Control
Structures}\label{introducing-control-structures}}

Python includes structures to control the flow of a program:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{conditions} (if, else)
\item
  \texttt{loops}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{while-loop}\strut \\
    Execute statements while a condition is true
  \item
    \texttt{for-loop}\strut \\
    Iterates over a iterable object (list, tuple, dict, set, string)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{indentation}{%
\section{Indentation}\label{indentation}}

This is where Python differs from most languages. To define control
structures,\\
and functional blocks of code in general, most languages use either
characters like braces \texttt{\{} and \texttt{\}} or key words like
\texttt{IF\ ...\ END\ IF}.

Python uses tabs -- spaces, actually -- to signify logical blocks off
code.

It is therefore imperative to understand and get a feel for indentation.

For loops are used to loop through a list of values or an operation in
which the number of iterations is \textbf{known} in advance.

While loops are when \textbf{you don't know} how many interations it
will take -- you are depending on some condition to be met.

It is possible for while loops to be unending, for example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\textbf{Purpose} - Define iterables and iterators - Using two methods,
show how iterators can be used to return data from sets, lists, strings,
tuples, dicts: - \texttt{for} loops\\
- \texttt{iter()} and \texttt{next()}

\textbf{Specific Topics} - iterable objects or iterables - iterators -
iteration - sequence - collection

\hypertarget{defining-iterables-and-iterators}{%
\chapter{Defining Iterables and
Iterators}\label{defining-iterables-and-iterators}}

\textbf{Iterable objects} or \textbf{iterables} can return elements one
at a time.

An \textbf{iterator} is an object that iterates over iterable objects
such as sets, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and strings.

\textbf{Iteration} can be implemented: - with a \texttt{for} loops -
with the \texttt{next()} method

Next, we show examples for various iterables.

\texttt{iter()} gets an iterator. Pops out a value each time it's used.

\texttt{next()} gets the next item from the iterator

\begin{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

Calling \texttt{next()} when the iterator has reached the end of the

Note that \texttt{for} implicitly creates an iterator and executes
\texttt{next()} on each loop iteration. This is best way to iterate
through a list-like object.

\hypertarget{sequences-and-collections}{%
\chapter{Sequences and Collections}\label{sequences-and-collections}}

We iterated over a list. Next we will illustrate for other iterables:
\texttt{str}, \texttt{tuple}, \texttt{set}, \texttt{dict}

lists, tuples, and strings are \textbf{sequences}. Sequences are
designed so that elements come out of them in the same order they were
put in.

Sets and dictionaries are not sequences, since they don't keep elements
in order. They are called \textbf{collections}. The ordering of the
items is arbitrary.

NOTE: This has changed for dictionaries in Python 3.7: \textgreater{}
the insertion-order preservation nature of dict objects has been
declared to be an official part of the Python language spec.\\

The code loops over each value in the list, checks the condition, and
appends to a new list.

The code works, but it's lengthy compared to a list comprehension.

The approach takes extra time to write and understand.

Let's solve with a list comprehension:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{is\_odd }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [val }\OperatorTok{\%} \DecValTok{2} \OperatorTok{==} \DecValTok{1} \ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ val }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ vals]}
\NormalTok{is\_odd}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[True, True, False, False, False, True]
\end{verbatim}

Much shorter, and if you understand the syntax, quicker to interpet.

Note the in-place use of an expression.

Now let's discuss the syntax.

\hypertarget{comprehensions-in-general}{%
\chapter{Comprehensions in General}\label{comprehensions-in-general}}

Comprehensions provide a concise method for iterating over any list-like
object to a new list like object.

There are comprehensions for each list-like object: * List
comprehensions * Dictionary comprehensions * Tuple comprehensions * Set
comprehensions

Comprehensions are essentially very concise \texttt{for} loops. They are
compact visually, but they also are more efficient than loops.

All comprehensions have the form:

listlike\_result = \texttt{{[}\ expression\ +\ context{]}}

The type of comprehension is indicated by the use of enclosing pairs,
just like anonymous constructors:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  List comprehensions \texttt{{[}expression\ +\ context{]}}
\item
  Dictionary comprehensions \texttt{\{expression\ +\ context\}}
\item
  Tuple comprehensions \texttt{(expression\ +\ context)}
\item
  Set comprehensions \texttt{\{expression\ +\ context\}}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Expression} defines what to do with each element in the list.
This has the structure of the kind of comprehension. So, dictionary
comprehension expressions take the form \texttt{k:v} while sets use
\texttt{v}.

\textbf{Context} defines which list elements to select. The context
always consists of an arbitrary number of \texttt{for} and \texttt{if}
statements.

Calling a function from the ``math'' library is straightforward:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Import Python's Math library with the command \texttt{import\ math}
\item
  Call methods from the imported \texttt{math} object using ``dot''
  notation, that is, .(any parameters).
\end{enumerate}

For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{math.sqrt(}\DecValTok{12}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Put all of your import statements at the very top of your code, before
anything else, other than any header comments (which you should have).

Here are some example math functions:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ math }\CommentTok{\# Typically best to put this line of code at the TOP of the file}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{math.sqrt(}\DecValTok{12}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{math.floor(}\FloatTok{2.5}\NormalTok{) }\CommentTok{\# returns largest whole number less than the argument}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
2
\end{verbatim}

Here's an example using the random library (a class).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ random }\CommentTok{\# Typically best to put this line of code at the TOP of the file}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{random.random()}\CommentTok{\# will return a number between 0 and 1 }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

If you know what specifics function you are going to use from a library,
you can import them directly, like so:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{from}\NormalTok{ math }\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ sqrt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This has two effects: 1. It reduces the memory used by the library in
your program. 2. It allows you to call the function directly, with the
object dot notation.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{from}\NormalTok{ math }\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ sqrt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{introduction-3}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-3}}

A function is piece of source code, separate fom the larger program,
that performs a specific task. This section of code is given a name and
can be called from the main program. It is called by using its given
name.

Functions are the \textbf{verbs} of a programming language. They signify
action, and take subjects and objects (as it were).

Functions take \textbf{input} and produce \textbf{output}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Function inputs are called both \textbf{parameters} and
  \textbf{arguments}.
\item
  Outputs are called \textbf{return} values
\end{itemize}

Functions are always written with parentheses at the end of their names,
e.g.

\texttt{len(some\_list)}

Internally, they contain a block of code to do their work.

Often the producte a \textbf{transformation} \ldots{} from simple to
complex.

When you use a function, we say you \textbf{call} a function.
Programmers speak of ``function calls'' and ``callbacks''.

\hypertarget{benefits}{%
\section{Benefits}\label{benefits}}

Reduce complex tasks into simpler tasks.

Eliminate duplicate code -- no need to re-write, reuse function as
needed.

Code reuse. Once function is written, you can reuse it in any other
program.

Distribute tasks to multiple programmers. For example, each function can
be written by someone.

Hide implementation details, i.e.~abstraction.

Increase code readability.

Improve debugging by improving traceability. Things are easier to
follow; you can jump from function to function.

\hypertarget{built-in-functions}{%
\section{Built-in Functions}\label{built-in-functions}}

Python provides many \textbf{built-in} functions. See
\href{https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html}{Python built-in
functions}.

We've looked at many of these already.

These are functions that are available to use any time your are running
Python.

To take one simple example, this is a built-in function:
\texttt{bool()}.

Takes an argument \(x\) and returns a boolean value, i.e.~\texttt{True}
or \texttt{False}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{bool}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{), }\BuiltInTok{bool}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{500}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{imported-functions}{%
\section{Imported Functions}\label{imported-functions}}

Python is meant to be a highly modular language.\\
It is not designed to have a lot of special purpose functions built into
it.\\
These keeps it light and highly customizable.

Many functions (and other stuff) can be imported into a program to add
to the functions that you can call in a script.

There are also many \textbf{packages} to bring in additional functions.

Packages and Libraries

\hypertarget{user-defined-functions}{%
\section{User-Defined Functions}\label{user-defined-functions}}

Python makes it easy for you to write your own functions. These are
called \textbf{user-defined} functions.

Let's write a function to compare the list against a threshold.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ vals\_greater\_than\_or\_equal\_to\_threshold(vals, thresh):}
    \CommentTok{\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}}
\CommentTok{    This is the "docstring" of a function. It is optional but expected. It describes it\textquotesingle{}s }
\CommentTok{    purpose and the nature of the input and return values, as well as a sense of what it does.}
\CommentTok{    More elaborate information should appear in external documentation packages with the function.}
\CommentTok{    }
\CommentTok{    PURPOSE: Given a list of values, compare each value against a threshold}
\CommentTok{    }
\CommentTok{    INPUTS}
\CommentTok{    vals    list of ints or floats}
\CommentTok{    thresh  int or float}
\CommentTok{    }
\CommentTok{    OUTPUT}
\CommentTok{    bools  list of booleans}
\CommentTok{    \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}}
    
\NormalTok{    bools }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [val }\OperatorTok{\textgreater{}=}\NormalTok{ thresh }\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ val }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ vals]}
    
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ bools}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{Let's break down the components}

The function definition starts with \texttt{def}, followed by name, one
or more arguments in parenthesis, and then a colon.

Next comes a \textbf{docstring} to provide information to users about
how and why to use the function.

The function \textbf{body} follows.

:astly is a \texttt{return} statement

The \textbf{function call} allows for the function to be used.\\
It consists of function name and required arguments:

\texttt{vals\_greater\_than\_or\_equal\_to\_threshold(arg1,\ arg2)}
where \texttt{arg1}, \texttt{arg2} are arbitrary names.

\hypertarget{about-the-docstring}{%
\subsection{About the docstring}\label{about-the-docstring}}

A \textbf{docstring} m occurs as first statement in module, function,
class, or method definition

Internally, it is saved in \texttt{\_\_doc\_\_} attribute of the
function object.

It needs to be indented.

It can be a single line or a multi-line string.

\hypertarget{lets-test-our-function}{%
\subsection{Let's test our function}\label{lets-test-our-function}}

The function body used a \texttt{list\ comprehension} for the compare:

\texttt{{[}val\ \textgreater{}=\ thresh\ for\ val\ in\ vals{]}}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\# validate that it works for ints}

\NormalTok{x }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{]}
\NormalTok{thr }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{4}

\NormalTok{vals\_greater\_than\_or\_equal\_to\_threshold(x, thr)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\# validate that it works for floats}

\NormalTok{x }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [}\FloatTok{3.0}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{4.2}\NormalTok{]}
\NormalTok{thr }\OperatorTok{=} \FloatTok{4.2}

\NormalTok{vals\_greater\_than\_or\_equal\_to\_threshold(x, thr)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\# vals\_greater\_than\_or\_equal\_to\_threshold("foo", "bar")}

This gives correct results and does exactly what we want.

\NormalTok{?vals\_greater\_than\_or\_equal\_to\_threshold}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{passing-parameters}{%
\section{Passing Parameters}\label{passing-parameters}}

Functions need to be called with correct number of parameters.

This function requires two params, but the function call includes only
one param.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ fcn\_bad\_args(x, y):}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ x }\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{ y}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fcn\_bad\_args(}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{parameter-order}{%
\subsection{Parameter Order}\label{parameter-order}}

When calling a function, \textbf{parameter order matters}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ fcn\_swapped\_args(x, y):}
\NormalTok{    out }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{5} \OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{ x }\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{ y}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ out}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{1}
\NormalTok{y }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fcn\_swapped\_args(x, y)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fcn\_swapped\_args(y, x)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Generally it's best to keep parameters in order.

You can swap the order by putting the parameter names in the function
call.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fcn\_swapped\_args(y}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{y, x}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{x)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{weirdness-alert}{%
\subsection{Weirdness Alert}\label{weirdness-alert}}

Note that the same name can be used for the parameter names and the
variables passed to them.

The names themselves have nothng to do with each other!

In other words, just because a function names an argument
\texttt{foo},\\
the variables passed to it don't have to name \texttt{foo} or anything
like it.\\
They can even be named the same thing -- it does not matter.

\hypertarget{unpacking-list-likes-with-args}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Unpacking List-likes with
\texttt{*args}}{Unpacking List-likes with *args}}\label{unpacking-list-likes-with-args}}

The \texttt{*} prefix operator can be passed to avoid specifying the
arguments individually.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ show\_arg\_expansion(}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{models):}
    
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"models          :"}\NormalTok{, models)}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"input arg type  :"}\NormalTok{,  }\BuiltInTok{type}\NormalTok{(models))}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"input arg length:"}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{len}\NormalTok{(models))}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}"}\NormalTok{)}
    
    \ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ mod }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ models:}
        \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(mod)    }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can pass a tuple of values to the function \ldots{}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{show\_arg\_expansion(}\StringTok{"logreg"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"naive\_bayes"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"gbm"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can also pass a list to the function.

If you want the elements unpacked, put \texttt{*} before the list.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{models }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [}\StringTok{"logreg"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"naive\_bayes"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"gbm"}\NormalTok{]}
\NormalTok{show\_arg\_expansion(}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{models)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This approach allows your function to accept an arbitrary number of
arguments.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{show\_arg\_expansion(}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}a b c d e f g\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{.split())}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{The reverse is true, too.}

You can use the \texttt{*} prefix to pass list-like objects to a
function that specifies its arguments.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ arg\_expansion\_example(x, y):}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ x}\OperatorTok{**}\NormalTok{y}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\NormalTok{arg\_expansion\_example(}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{my\_args)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

But, the passed object must be the right length.

\begin{Shaded}

\hypertarget{default-arguments}{%

Use default arguments to set the value of arguments when left
unspecified.

\NormalTok{pr }\OperatorTok{=} \FloatTok{0.912}
\NormalTok{res }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ show\_results(pr)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The function call didn't specify \texttt{printing}, so it defaulted to
True.

\textbf{NOTE:} Default arguments must follow non-default arguments. This
causes trouble:

\begin{Shaded}

    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ precision}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{returning-values}{%
\section{Returning Values}\label{returning-values}}

Functions are not required to have return statement.

If there is no return statement, a function returns \texttt{None}.

Functions can return no value (\texttt{None}), one value, or many.

Many values are returned as a tuple.

Any Python object can be returned.

\BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}c =\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, c)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{If you don't need an output, use the dummy variable \texttt{\_}}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{d, e, \_ }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ negate\_coords(}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{20}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{30}\NormalTok{)}

\BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}e =\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, e)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{Note:} It's generally a good idea to include return statements,
even if not returning a value.

This shows that you did not forget to consider the return value.

You can use \texttt{return} or \texttt{return\ None}.

\textbf{Functions can contain multiple return statements}.

These may be used under different logical conditions.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ absolute\_value(num):}
    \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ num }\OperatorTok{\textgreater{}=} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{:}
        \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ num}
    \ControlFlowTok{return} \OperatorTok{{-}}\NormalTok{num}

\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{absolute\_value(}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

For non-negative values, the first \texttt{return} is reached.\\
For negative values, the second \texttt{return} is reached.

\hypertarget{function-design}{%
\section{Function Design}\label{function-design}}

A function is not just a bag of code!

Some good practices for creating and using functions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  design a function to do one thing
\end{itemize}

Make them as simple as possible, which makes them:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  more comprehensible
\item
  easier to maintain
\item
  reusable
\end{itemize}

This helps avoid situations where a team has 20 variations of similar
functions.

Give your function a good name.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It should reflect the action it performs.
\item
  Be consistent in your naming conventions.
\item
  A name like \texttt{compute\_variances\_sort\_save\_print} suggests
  the function is overworked!
\end{itemize}

If the function \texttt{compute\_variances} also produces plots and
updates variables, it will cause confusion.

Always give your function a docstring - Particularly important since
indicating data types is not required.\\
- As a side note, you can include this information by using \textbf{type
annotation}.

Finally, at some point you may be interested to learn some of the
formatting languages that have been developed to write docstrings. See

\hypertarget{introduction-4}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-4}}

Python lambda functions are small, informal functions. They don't get a
name.

The are ``anonymous.''

From Lutz 2019:

\begin{quote}
Besides the \texttt{def} statement, Python also provides an expression
form that generates function objects. Because of its similarity to a
tool in the Lisp language, it's called lambda. Like \texttt{def}, this
expression creates a function to be called later, but it returns the
function instead of assigning it to a name. This is why lambdas are
sometimes known as anonymous (i.e., unnamed) functions. In practice,
they are often used as a way to inline a function definition, or to
defer execution of a piece of code.
\end{quote}

The general form of a lambda function is:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{lambda}\NormalTok{ x: x}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
<function __main__.<lambda>(x)>
\end{verbatim}

You can call the function like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{lambda}\NormalTok{ x: x)(}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\chapter{NB: Recursion}\label{nb-recursion}}

\textbf{Concepts} - recursion - recursive function - stack - stack
overflow

\hypertarget{introduction-5}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-5}}

A recursive function is \textbf{a function that calls itself}.

This is weird, since it does not seem possible. How can a definition
refer to itself?

In philosophy, this is expressed in the Barber's Paradox:

\begin{quote}
The barber is the one who shaves all those, and those only, who do not
shave themselves. Does the barber shave himself?
\end{quote}

Formally, it is a type of
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reference}{self-reference},
like \texttt{This\ sentence\ is\ false.}

\textbf{A Cute Definition}

\textbf{recursion} - the art of defining something (at least partly) in
terms of itself, which is a naughty no-no in dictionaries but often
works out okay in computer programs if you're careful not to recurse
forever (which is like an infinite loop with more spectacular failure
modes).

Source: \emph{PerlDoc}

\hypertarget{a-formal-definition}{%
\subsection{A Formal Definition}\label{a-formal-definition}}

In mathematics and computer science, a class of objects or methods
exhibits \emph{recursive behavior} when it can be defined by two
properties:

A \textbf{simple base} case (or cases): a terminating scenario that does
not use recursion to produce an answer.

A \textbf{recursive step}: a set of rules that reduces all successive
cases toward the base case.

\hypertarget{as-seen-in-nature}{%
\subsection{As Seen in Nature}\label{as-seen-in-nature}}

Recursion occurs naturally when a process applies a rule to itself
successively.

We see this in fractals.

\hypertarget{infinite-loops-and-stack-overflows}{%
\subsection{Infinite Loops and Stack
Overflows}\label{infinite-loops-and-stack-overflows}}

Every recursive function must have a base condition that stops the
recursion or else the function calls itself infinitely.

The Python interpreter limits the depths of recursion to help avoid
infinite recursions, resulting in stack overflows.

The \textbf{call stack} is where information is stored relating to the
active subroutines in a program.

The call stack has a limited amount of available memory. When excessive
memory consumption occurs on the call stack, it results in a
\textbf{stack overflow error}.

\hypertarget{a-note-of-caution}{%
\subsection{A Note of Caution}\label{a-note-of-caution}}

So, Recursion is cool, but is expensive and complicated.

Recursive functions can usually be implemented by traditional loops.

The factorial of a number \(n\) is the product of all the integers from
\(1\) to \(n\).

For example, the factorial of \(5\) (denoted as \(5!\)) is
\(1\times2\times3\times4\times5 = 120\).

Let's implement this in code using a recursive function.

\texttt{seq}. * For example, in the Fibonacci sequence, seq is
\texttt{{[}1,\ 1,\ 2{]}} * The function to apply to the sequence at each
iteration, represneted as a \texttt{lambda} function with the arguments
\texttt{x} and \texttt{i} for the the sequence list \texttt{seq} and the
iteration number respectively. * For example, in the Fibonacci sequence
the kernel function is
\texttt{lambda\ x,\ i:\ x{[}i-1{]}\ +\ x{[}i-2{]}}

\section{Overview}\label{overview-1}}

A variable's \textbf{scope} is the part of a program where it is
\textbf{visible}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Scope refers to the \textbf{coding region}, such as a function block,
  from which a particular Python object is accessible.
\item
  Visible means available or \textbf{usable} to the code block in
  question.
\item
  If a variable is \textbf{in scope} to a function, it is visible the
  function.
\item
  If it is \textbf{out of scope} to a function, it is not visible the
  function.
\end{itemize}

When a variable is defined \textbf{inside} of a function, is is not
visible outside of the function. * We say such variables are
\textbf{local} to the function. * They are also removed from memory when
the function completes.

When a variable is defined \textbf{outside} of any function in a script,
it is visible to any function inside of the script * We say such
variables are \textbf{global} to the functions in the file or context in
which the variables are defined. * A function can replace a global
variable with local variable by defining that variable. In this case, a
variable can have global and local versions in the same program.

Sometimes variable scope is called \textbf{lexical} scope.

It is helpful to have a good understanding of scope to avoid surprises
and confusion.

The concept is easier than it may look in the abstract. Let's look at
some examples where we vary the use of local and global definitions of
\texttt{x}.

\hypertarget{lutz-on-scoping}{%
\section{Lutz on Scoping}\label{lutz-on-scoping}}

Here's an excerpt from
\href{https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-python-5th/9781449355722/ch17.html\#scope_details}{Lutz,
Chapter 17}. Please read the whole thing.

\textbf{The enclosing module is a global scope.} Each module is a global
scope---that is, a namespace in which variables created (assigned) at
the top level of the module file live. Global variables become
attributes of a module object to the outside world after imports but can
also be used as simple variables within the module file itself.

\textbf{The global scope spans a single file only.} Don't be fooled by
the word ``global'' here---names at the top level of a file are global
to code within that single file only. There is really no notion of a
single, all-encompassing global file-based scope in Python. Instead,
names are partitioned into modules, and you must always import a module
explicitly if you want to be able to use the names its file defines.
\textbf{When you hear ``global'' in Python, think ``module.''}

\textbf{Assigned names are local unless declared global or nonlocal.} By
default, all the names assigned inside a function definition are put in
the local scope (the namespace associated with the function call). If
you need to assign a name that lives at the top level of the module
enclosing the function, you can do so by declaring it in a global
statement inside the function. If you need to assign a name that lives
in an enclosing def, as of Python 3.X you can do so by declaring it in a
nonlocal statement.

\textbf{All other names are enclosing function locals, globals, or
built-ins.} Names not assigned a value in the function definition are
assumed to be enclosing scope locals, defined in a physically
surrounding def statement; globals that live in the enclosing module's
namespace; or built-ins in the predefined built-ins module Python
provides.

\textbf{Each call to a function creates a new local scope.} Every time
you call a function, you create a new local scope---that is, a namespace
in which the names created inside that function will usually live. You
can think of each def statement (and lambda expression) as defining a
new local scope, but the local scope actually corresponds to a function
call. Because Python allows functions to call themselves to loop---an
advanced technique known as recursion and noted briefly in Chapter~9
when we explored comparisons---each active call receives its own copy of
the function's local variables. Recursion is useful in functions we
write as well, to process structures whose shapes can't be predicted
ahead of time; we'll explore it more fully in Chapter~19.

And here is a nice visualization of scopes:

\hypertarget{the-tinted-glass-metaphor}{%
\section{The Tinted Glass Metaphor}\label{the-tinted-glass-metaphor}}

So, code regions within a program are like vehicles with tinted glass: *
Passengers can see outside, but outsiders can't see inside. * Passengers
in a vehicle can let outsiders look in by lowering the window.

Or something. Lile models, all metaphors are wrong, but some are useful.

\textbf{\texttt{x} defined outside a function but used inside of it}

In the code below: * \texttt{x} is \textbf{global} and seen from inside
the function.\\
* \texttt{a} is \textbf{local} to the function. trying to print outside
function throws error.

Note that arguments are essentially locally defined variables.

The \texttt{x} on the left is \texttt{local}, since it is being
\emph{defined} inside the function.

However, the \texttt{x} on the right is assumed to already be defined,

In effect, Python is presented with a contradiction and so throws an

We will see that R does not do this; it just goes with the
\texttt{global}.

\hypertarget{namespaces}{%
\section{Namespaces}\label{namespaces}}

Definitions of scope make reference to \textbf{namespaces}. Scope and
namespaces are closely intertwined concepts. Sometimes it is assumed
that the reader knows what this means.

If you've never heard of namespaces, or are unsure of what they are,
here's a brief explanation.

A namespace is a system that allows for \textbf{a unique name} to
associated with each and \textbf{every object} in a Python program. *
Remember that \textbf{an object can be anything} in Python, not just
variable, e.g.~a function or a class. * Python maintains namespaces
internally as \textbf{dictionaries}.

A good \textbf{analogy} to a namespace system is the \textbf{file
system} on a computer. You can have files of the same name so long as
they are in different folders. The complete name of the file is actually
the filename and the names of its parent folders, i.e.~the path to the
file in the file system.

Another anology is in \textbf{human names} -- personal names and family
names, i.e.~first and last names in European countries. These in turn
might be contained by larger social groupings.

Finally, another analogy is \textbf{home addresses} -- house numbers and
street names can be reused based on their ``path'' in the tree of
geographic entities that include cities, states, nations, etc.

Similarly, Python understands what exact method or variable one is
trying to point to in the code, depending upon the namespace.

Note that in each of these cases, \textbf{the data structure is a
directed acyclic graph (DAG)}, which is universal structure for
organizing unique names.

\hypertarget{some-visualizations}{%
\section{Some Visualizations}\label{some-visualizations}}

The same object name can be present in multiple namespaces as isolation
between the same name is maintained by their namespace.

\textbf{Purpose}: * Illustrate concept of function design * Demonstrate
how functions can break down a process into simple components *
Demonstrate how component functions build on each other * Introduce idea
of functional groups * Motivate use of classes (to be introduced later)

\hypertarget{basic-insight}{%
\section{Basic Insight}\label{basic-insight}}

Functions contain any code, so they can contain functions. * Functions
can call other functions * Functions can define new functions

We create functions that call functions in order to break a complex
process into components. * Some functions focus on simple component
processes * Other functions combine these into higher order processes *
Some functions may be focused on computation, while others may be
focused on interacting with users or data sources * We can think of this
a division of labor, or ``separation of concerns,'' among functions

When you create groups of functions, they often form natural groups that
associated with a common process or task. * These function groups often
share variables in addition to calling each ohter

Let's look at some examples to illustrate these points.

We write two related functions: * One to compute the \textbf{tax} based
on a \textbf{gross pay} and a \textbf{tax rate}. * One to compute the
\textbf{net pay} using the previous function.

In addition, we want to write some functions that use these functions to
interact with a user. * One to get the input value of the gross pay and
print the tax. * One to print the net pay based on the previous
function.

Note the division of labor, or ``separation of concerns'', in these
functions: * Some do calculative work * Some do interactive work

To compute tax, we have these data:

\begin{verbatim}
gross_pay    tax_rate
---------------------
0   - 240    0%
241 - 480    15%
481 - more   28%

global variables to exist and use these instead of return statements. \\

\hypertarget{using-time}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Using
\texttt{time}}{Using time}}\label{using-time}}

One way to get the runtime of a code block is to use the \texttt{time}
module.

\textbf{About time}

The \texttt{time} module provides a number of functions to get and
compute time.

The simplest function is \texttt{time()}, which just returns the number
of seconds elapsed since the Epoch.

The Epoch is \texttt{00:00:00\ UTC} on 1 January 1970, excluding
leapseconds.

It corresponds roughly to when Unix was invented.

\hypertarget{using-timeit}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Using
\texttt{timeit}}{Using timeit}}\label{using-timeit}}

To get a better measure of runtime, we can use \texttt{timeit}, which
measures timing across many runs.

Note that \texttt{timeit()} will return the runtime across ALL runs. To
get the mean runtime, you need to divide by the number of runs.

\texttt{timeit()} works by evaluating code blocks written as strings.

\hypertarget{using-magic}{%
\section{Using Magic}\label{using-magic}}

Instead of calling \texttt{time} and \texttt{timeit} directly, we can
use the so-called magic commands.

Magic commands are \texttt{\%} or \texttt{\%\%} prefixed commands that
work in Jupyter notebooks and other IPython environments.

\texttt{\%} commands apply to \textbf{single lines}; they go at the
beginning of the line.

\texttt{\%\%} commands apply to \textbf{cell blocks}; they go at the top
of the cell.

Magic commands can take arguments. For more info, see * Chapter 3 in Wes
McKinney's
\href{https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781449323592/ch03.html}{\emph{Python
for Data Analysis}}. * The
\href{https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html}{official
documentation}

Placing \texttt{\%\%timeit} or \texttt{\%\%time} at the top of a cell
will appy these functions to the cell block.

Placing \texttt{\%timeit} or \texttt{\%time} as the first item on a line
of code will apply the to a single line.

\textbf{Types of Time}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Wall clock time} measures how much time has passed, as if you
  were looking at the clock on your wall.
\item
  \textbf{CPU time} refers to how many seconds the CPU was actually

\section{\texorpdfstring{Open Files with
\texttt{open()}}{Open Files with open()}}\label{open-files-with-open}}

Let's open a sample CSV file, \texttt{biostats.csv}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This has some biometric statistics for a group of office workers.
\item
  There are 18 records, recording Name, Sex, Age, Height, Weight
\item
  There is an initial header line.
\item
  This file was downloaded from
  https://people.sc.fsu.edu/\textasciitilde jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html
  and modified slightly.
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{src\_file\_name }\OperatorTok{=} \StringTok{"./sample\_data\_files/biostats.csv"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We call the \texttt{open()} function and pass it two parameters: * The
name of the file we want to open. * The mode in which the file is
opened. It defaults to \texttt{r} which means open for reading in text
mode. Other common values are: * \texttt{w} for writing (truncating the
file if it already exists) * \texttt{x} for creating and writing to a
new file * \texttt{a} for appending

The returns a file object whose type depends on the mode and through
which the standard file operations such as reading and writing are
performed. So, to read from the file, you need to have specified type
\texttt{r} and to write you need to have specified \texttt{w}.

The file object is an iterator.

For more info, check out
\href{https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html\#open}{the Python
docs} or run \texttt{open?} from a code cell.

Note, we sometimes call the file object a file ``handle.''

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\# open?}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{file\_handle }\OperatorTok{=} \BuiltInTok{open}\NormalTok{(src\_file\_name, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}r\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\texttt{.read()} reads in the file as one long string.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{file\_as\_big\_string }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ file\_handle.read()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{file\_as\_big\_string[:}\DecValTok{1000}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Since the file object is an iterator, we can't get the string again from
the object.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{file\_as\_big\_string }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ file\_handle.read() }\CommentTok{\# Try reading from the handle again}
\NormalTok{file\_as\_big\_string[:}\DecValTok{1000}\NormalTok{] }\CommentTok{\# Nothing there since the iterator is exhausted}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

So, let's create a new handle, read in the contents again, and then
parse our string by newlines using \texttt{.split("\textbackslash{}n")}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{file\_handle }\OperatorTok{=} \BuiltInTok{open}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"./sample\_data\_files/biostats.csv"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}r\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{file\_as\_big\_string }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ file\_handle.read()}
\NormalTok{file\_as\_big\_string.split(}\StringTok{"}\CharTok{\textbackslash{}n}\StringTok{"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

A short-cut to this process is to call the \texttt{.readlines()} method,
which returns a pre-made list of lines.

Note that the newlines are preserved in this case.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{file\_handle }\OperatorTok{=} \BuiltInTok{open}\NormalTok{(src\_file\_name, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}r\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{file\_as\_list\_of\_strings }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ file\_handle.readlines()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{file\_as\_list\_of\_strings}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

File objects should be closed when you are done with them.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{file\_handle.close()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{use-a-with-block}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Use a \texttt{with}
block}{Use a with block}}\label{use-a-with-block}}

\ldots{} to automatically open and close the file i/o object

There is a better way to handle objects that need to be closed.

Other examples of such objects are database handles.

\texttt{with} will automatically open and close the file handle.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{with} \BuiltInTok{open}\NormalTok{(src\_file\_name, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}r\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{) }\ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ infile:}
\NormalTok{    file\_as\_list }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ infile.readlines()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{convert-into-a-2d-list}{%
\section{Convert into a 2D list}\label{convert-into-a-2d-list}}

Let's covert our list of strings to a list of lists, the former being
the rows of data table and the latter the cells.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\# \%\%time}
\NormalTok{list\_2d }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ []}
\ControlFlowTok{with} \BuiltInTok{open}\NormalTok{(src\_file\_name, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}r\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{) }\ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ infile:}
    \ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ line }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ infile.readlines():}
\NormalTok{        row }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ line.rstrip().split(}\StringTok{","}\NormalTok{) }\CommentTok{\# Note the use of rstrip()}
\NormalTok{        list\_2d.append(row)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{list\_2d}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that we now have do something with the column names and handle
formating and casting each cell.

Numpy arrays must be of the same data types, and it also has no concept

\section{Converting Data Types}\label{converting-data-types}}

Let's try to convert the data types of the numeric columns from strings
to integers. One thing we might do is the following:

\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{np\_matrix[:, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{:}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{].astype(}\BuiltInTok{int}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We see that the strings are converted to integers.

So, let's try to save the conversion results to the original array:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{np\_matrix[:, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{:}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{] }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ np\_matrix[:, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{:}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{].astype(}\BuiltInTok{int}\NormalTok{)}

\hypertarget{some-difficulties}{%
\section{Some Difficulties}\label{some-difficulties}}

It is pretty easy to import CSV files this way, but there are many
difficulties you are likely to encounter if you use this as your default
pattern for importing data. Here are just a few: - \textbf{Not all
sources are well-formed}. They may have delimitters that are complex to
parse, and the the data themselve may be hard to parse. - \textbf{You
have to keep the column names in a separate list or vector} and then
associate them with the data if and when necessary. - \textbf{You have
to convert each column vector into its appropriate data type yourself.}
Or, you have to create separate 2D arrays for each collection of columns
with a common data type. This process also invovles human inspection of
the file, as opposed to have a program try to figure it out for you.

For these reasons, other tools such as Pandas were created to make the
work of a data scientist a bit easier and more productive.

\hypertarget{numpy}{%
\section{NumPy}\label{numpy}}

\textbf{A new data structure}

Essentially, NumPy introduces a new data structure to Python -- the
\textbf{n-dimensional array}. Along with it, it introduces a collection
of function and methods that take advantage of this data structure.

The data structure is designed to support the use of \textbf{numerical
methods}: algorithmic approximations to the problems of mathematical
analysis.

\textbf{New Functions}

It also provides a new way of appling functions to day made possible by
the data structure -- \textbf{vectorized functions}. Vectorized
functions replace the use of loops and comprehensions to apply a
function to a set of data.

In addition, given the data structure, it provides a library of
\textbf{linear algebra} functions.

\textbf{New Data Types}

NumPy also introduces a bunch of new \textbf{data types}.

\textbf{Python for Science}

Finally, because
\href{https://www.britannica.com/science/numerical-analysis}{numerical
methods} are so important to so many sciences, NumPy is the basis of
what is called \textbf{the scientific ``stack''} in Python, which
consists of SciPy, Matplotlib, SciKitLearn, and Pandas. All of these
assume that you have some knowledge of NumPy.

Let's take a look at it.

\begin{Shaded}

\hypertarget{the-ndarray}{%

The ndarray is a multidimensional array object.

Let's explore it some.

First, let's generate some fake data using NumPy's built-a random number
generator.

\hypertarget{about-dimensions}{%
\subsection{About Dimensions}\label{about-dimensions}}

The term dimension is ambiguous. * Sometimes refers to the dimensions of
things in the world, such as space and time. * Sometimes refers to the
dimensions of a data structure, independent of what it represents in the
world.

NumPy dimensions are the latter, although they can be used to represent
the former, as physicists do.

The dimensions of data structures are sometimes called \textbf{axes}.

Consider this: Three-dimensional space can be represented as three
columns in a two-dimensional table OR as three axes in a data cube.

As NumPy has been designed with large data use cases in mind, you could
imagine performance and memory problems if NumPy insisted on copying
data left and right.

⭐ If you want a copy of a slice of an ndarray instead of a view, you
will need to explicitly copy the array; for example
\texttt{arr{[}5:8{]}.copy()}.

If find NumPy's way of show the data a bit difficult to parse visually.

💡 \textbf{Here is a way to visualize 3 and higher dimensional data:}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{[ }\CommentTok{\# AXIS 0                     CONTAINS 2 ELEMENTS (arrays)}
\NormalTok{    [ }\CommentTok{\# AXIS 1                 CONTAINS 2 ELEMENTS (arrays)}
\NormalTok{        [}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{], }\CommentTok{\# AXIS 3    CONTAINS 3 ELEMENTS (integers)}
\NormalTok{        [}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{]  }\CommentTok{\# AXIS 3}
\NormalTok{    ],  }
\NormalTok{    [ }\CommentTok{\# AXIS 1}
\NormalTok{        [}\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{8}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{9}\NormalTok{], }
\NormalTok{        [}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{11}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{12}\NormalTok{]}
\NormalTok{    ]}
\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Each axis is a level in the nested hierarchy, i.e.~a tree or DAG
(directed-acyclic graph).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Each axis is a container.
\item
  There is only one top container.
\item
  Only the bottom containers have data.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Omit lower indices}

In multidimensional arrays, if you omit later indices, the returned
object will be a \textbf{lower-dimensional ndarray} consisting of all
the data contained by the higher indexed dimension.

So in the 2 × 2 × 3 array \texttt{arr3d}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{arr3d[}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Saving data before modifying an array.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{old\_values }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ arr3d[}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{].copy()}
\NormalTok{arr3d[}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{] }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{42}
\NormalTok{arr3d}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Putting the data back.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{arr3d[}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{] }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ old\_values}
\NormalTok{arr3d}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Similarly, \texttt{arr3d{[}1,\ 0{]}} gives you all of the values whose
indices start with (1, 0), forming a 1-dimensional array:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{arr3d[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{]}

\hypertarget{boolean-indexing}{%
\subsection{Boolean Indexing}\label{boolean-indexing}}

This a crucial topic -- it applies to Pandas and R.

You can pass a boolean representation of an array to the array indexer
(i.e.~\texttt{{[}{]}}) and it will return only those cells that are
\texttt{True}.

This is like replace \texttt{IF} statements with a \texttt{dict}.

Let's assume that we have two related arrays: * \texttt{names} which is
the rows (observations) of a table * \texttt{data} which holds the data
associated with each feature

There are \(7\) observations and \(4\) features.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{names }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ np.array([}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Bob\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Joe\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Will\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Bob\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Will\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Joe\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Joe\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{])}
\NormalTok{names}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{data }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ np.random.randn(}\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{data}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{names.shape, data.shape}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

A comparison operation in an array returns an array of booleans.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{names }\OperatorTok{==} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Bob\textquotesingle{}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This array can be passed to an array indexer:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{data[names }\OperatorTok{==} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Bob\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Along the second axis, we can use a slice to select data.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{data[names }\OperatorTok{==} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Bob\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{:]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{data[names }\OperatorTok{==} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Bob\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you know SQL, this is like the query:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT}\NormalTok{ col3, col4 }\KeywordTok{FROM} \KeywordTok{data} \KeywordTok{WHERE}\NormalTok{ name }\OperatorTok{=} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Bob\textquotesingle{}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here are some examples of boolean operations being applied.

Note that we don't use \texttt{not} but instead the tilde
\texttt{\textasciitilde{}} sign to negate (flip) a value.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{names }\OperatorTok{!=} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Bob\textquotesingle{}}
\NormalTok{data[}\OperatorTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{(names }\OperatorTok{==} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Bob\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{)]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{cond }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ names }\OperatorTok{==} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Bob\textquotesingle{}}
\NormalTok{data[}\OperatorTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{cond]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Similarly, we don't use \texttt{and} and \texttt{or} but \texttt{\&} and
\texttt{\textbar{}}.

Also, expressions join by these operators need to be in parentheses.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{mask }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ (names }\OperatorTok{==} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Bob\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{|}\NormalTok{ (names }\OperatorTok{==} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Will\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{mask}
\NormalTok{data[mask]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{data[data }\OperatorTok{\textless{}} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{] }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{0}
\NormalTok{data}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{data[names }\OperatorTok{!=} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Joe\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{] }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{7}
\NormalTok{data}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{fancy-indexing}{%
\subsection{Fancy Indexing}\label{fancy-indexing}}

In so-call fancy indexing, we use array index numbers to access data.

We pass a \texttt{list} of item numbers, instead of an integer or
integer range with \texttt{:}, to the indexer.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{arr }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ np.empty((}\DecValTok{8}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{))}
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ i }\KeywordTok{in} \BuiltInTok{range}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{8}\NormalTok{):}
\NormalTok{    arr[i] }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ i}
\NormalTok{arr}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This says: \emph{Select rows 4, 3, 0, and 6, in that order.}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{arr[[}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{]]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And we can go backwards.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{arr[[}\OperatorTok{{-}}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\OperatorTok{{-}}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\OperatorTok{{-}}\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{]]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{arr }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ np.arange(}\DecValTok{32}\NormalTok{).reshape((}\DecValTok{8}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{))}
\NormalTok{arr}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can drop these lists into each axis seletor.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{arr[[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{], [}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{]]}

\hypertarget{transposing-arrays-and-swapping-axes}{%
\subsection{Transposing Arrays and Swapping
Axes}\label{transposing-arrays-and-swapping-axes}}

Transposing is a special form of reshaping which similarly returns a
view on the underlying data without copying anything.

Arrays have the transpose method and also the special \texttt{T}
attribute:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{arr }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ np.arange(}\DecValTok{15}\NormalTok{).reshape((}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{))}
\NormalTok{arr}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{arr.T}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Transposing is often used when computing the dot product between two
arrays.

Here's an example.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{arr }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ np.random.randn(}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{arr}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{np.dot(arr.T, arr)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

For higher dimensional arrays, \texttt{transpose} will accept a tuple of
axis numbers to permute the axes.

Warning -- this can get confusing to conceptualize and visualize!

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{arr }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ np.arange(}\DecValTok{16}\NormalTok{).reshape((}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{))}
\NormalTok{arr}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{arr.transpose((}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Simple transposing with \texttt{.T} is just a special case of swapping
axes. ndarray has the method \texttt{swapaxes} which takes a pair of
axis numbers:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| jupyter: \{outputs\_hidden: false\}}
\NormalTok{arr}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

has \(6\) elements. In this case, these elements are arrays. * The
second dimension, axis 1, has \(4\) elements. Its elements are scalars

The shape of \texttt{foo{[}0{]}} is \(4\). It contains \(1\) axis with

It has a shape of \(1\) and not \(4 \times 1\) because it is a vector,
not a matrix.

\textbf{SO, there is a difference between a vector and a 1-column
matrix.}

If we want to make it into a 1-column matrix, we need to reshape it
using \texttt{np.reshape()}.

Note that the first value of the shape argument is \(-1\). This means
use the length of the vector that is passed to it.

Sometimes, you need to convert vectors into 1-column matrices to make
certain linear algebraic functions work.

Consider two random variables, \(x\) and \(y\).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ np.random.randn(}\DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{)}

We can fit a regression line using the \textbf{normal equation}, which
appears in this week's homework.

\(\begin{aligned} \hat\beta_i=(x^Tx)^{−1}x^Ty \end{aligned}\)

Here is a standward way of expressing it in NumPy:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{get\_beta1 }\OperatorTok{=} \KeywordTok{lambda}\NormalTok{ x, y: (np.linalg.inv(x.T.dot(x))) }\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{ (x.T.dot(y))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

However, it will fail if we pass it our two variables, \texttt{x} and
\texttt{y}.

The reason is that it expects \texttt{x} to be a matrix, since it is
designed to handle n-dimension predictor variables, usually represented
as \(\textbf{X}\).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{get\_beta1(x, y)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The revised function will work with a vector as \texttt{x}:

\(\hat\beta_i = \large\frac{1}{x^Tx} \small(x^Ty)\)

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{get\_beta2 }\OperatorTok{=} \KeywordTok{lambda}\NormalTok{ x, y: (}\DecValTok{1} \OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{ x.T.dot(x)) }\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{ (x.T.dot(y))}

\section{Array-Oriented Programming}\label{array-oriented-programming}}

Using NumPy arrays enables you to express many kinds of data processing
tasks as concise array expressions \textbf{without writing loops}.

This practice of \textbf{replacing explicit loops with array
expressions} is referred to by some people as \textbf{vectorization}.

Vectorized array operations are often significantly \textbf{faster} than
their pure Python equivalents.

They are also \textbf{visually concise and elegant}, although loops have
the virtue of visualizing what's under the hood in an algorithm.

Dot product of two arrays. Specifically, - If both \texttt{a} and
\texttt{b} are 1-D arrays, it is inner product of vectors (without
complex conjugation). - If both \texttt{a} and \texttt{b} are 2-D
arrays, it is matrix multiplication, but using \texttt{matmul()} or
\texttt{a\ @\ b} is preferred. - If either \texttt{a} or \texttt{b} is
0-D (scalar), it is equivalent to \texttt{multiply()} and using
\texttt{numpy.multiply(a,\ b)} or \texttt{a\ *\ b} is preferred. - If
\texttt{a} is an N-D array and \texttt{b} is a 1-D array, it is a sum
product over the last axis of \texttt{a} and \texttt{b}. - If \texttt{a}
is an N-D array and \texttt{b} is an M-D array (where
\texttt{M\textgreater{}=2}), it is a sum product over the last axis of
\texttt{a} and the second-to-last axis of \texttt{b}:

\hypertarget{pandas-dataframes}{%
\section{Pandas DataFrames}\label{pandas-dataframes}}

Just as NumPy introduces the n-dimensional array as a new data structure
to Python, so Pandas introduces two:

The \textbf{Series}: a 1-dimensional labeled array capable of holding
any data type.

The \textbf{DataFrame}: a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with
columns of potentially different types.

\begin{quote}
Note: Pandas used to have a 3-dimensional structure called a
\textbf{panel}, but it has been removed from the library.\\
Ironically, the name ``pandas'' was partly derived the word ``panel'':
\(pan(el)-da(ta)-s\).\\
To handle higher dimensional data, the Pandas team suggests using
\href{https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/}{XArray}, which also build on
NumPy arrays.
\end{quote}

By far, the most important data structure in Pandas is the dataframe,
with the series playing a supporting -- but crucial -- role.

In fact, dataframe objects are built out of series objects.

So, \textbf{to understand what a dataframe is and how it behaves, you
need to understand what is series is and how it is constructed.}

Before going into that, here are two quick observations about
dataframes:

First, dataframes are \textbf{inspired by the R structure} of the same
name. They have many similarities, but there are fundamental differences
between the two that go beyond mere language differences. Most important
is the Pandas dataframes have \textbf{indexes}, whereas R dataframes do
not.

Second, it is helpful to think of Pandas as wrapper around NumPy and
Matplotlib that makes it much easier to perform common operations, like
select data by column name or visualizing plots. But this comes at a
cost -- Pandas is slower than NumPy. The represents the classic
trade-off between \textbf{ease-of-use} for humnas and machine
\textbf{performance}.

\hypertarget{series-objects}{%
\section{Series Objects}\label{series-objects}}

\hypertarget{axis-labels-indexes}{%
\subsection{Axis Labels (Indexes)}\label{axis-labels-indexes}}

A series is at heart a one-dimensional array with \textbf{labels} along
its axis. * It's data must be of a single type, like NumPy arrays (which
they are internally).

The axis labels are collectively referred to as the \textbf{index}.

Think of \textbf{the index as a separate data structure} that is
attached to the array. * The array holds the data. * The index holds the
names of the observations or things that the data are about.

So, Pandas moves us out of what we called anonymous data.

Why have an index? * Provides a way to access elements of the array by
name * Allows series objects that share index labels to be combined

In fact, \textbf{a dataframe is a collection of series} with a common
index.

To this collection of series the dataframe adds a set of labels along
the horizontal axis. * The index is \textbf{axis 0} * The columns are
another kind of index, called \textbf{axis 1}

Note that both index and column labels can be \textbf{multidimensional}.
* The are called Hierarchical Indexes and go the technical name of
\texttt{MultiIndexes}. * As an example, consider that a table of text
data people might have a two-column index:
\texttt{(book\_id,\ chap\_id)} * See
\href{https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/advanced.html}{the
Pandas documentation}.

It is \textbf{crucial} to understand the difference between the index of
a dataframe and its data in order to understand how dataframes work.

Many a headache is caused by not understanding this difference :-)

\textbf{Indexes are powerful and controversial.} * They allow for all
kinds of magic to take place when combining and accessing data. * But
they are expensive and sometimes hard to work with (especially
multiindexes). * They are especially difficult if you are coming from R
and expecting dataframes to behave a certain way.

But enough introduction.

Let's dive into how Pandas objects work in practice.

We import pandas like this, using the alias \texttt{pd} by convention:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ pandas }\ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ pd}
\end{Highlighting}

We almost always import NumPy, too, since we use many of its functions

\textbf{Dot} (i.e.~as object attribute)

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Dot notation is very convenient, since as object attributes they can be
tab-completed in various editing environments.

But: - It only works if the column names are not reserved words - It
can't be used when created a new column (see below)

It is convenient to names columns with a prefix,
e.g.~\texttt{doc\_title}, \texttt{doc\_year}, \texttt{doc\_author}, etc.

Column attributes and methods work with both:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{df.y.values, df[}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}y\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{].values}

\hypertarget{adding-new-columns}{%

It is typical to create a new column from existing columns.

We can also redefine indexes to reflect the logic of our data.

In this data set, the species of the flower is part of its
\textbf{identity}, so it can be part of the index.

(Note that is also a label that can be used for training a model to
predict the species of an iris flower. In that use case, the column

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\hypertarget{combining-filtering-and-selecting}{%
\subsection{Combining Filtering and
Selecting}\label{combining-filtering-and-selecting}}

So, remember the comma notation from NumPy -- it is used here.

The first element is a row selector, the second a column selector.

In database terminology, row selection is called filtering.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

You can apply slices to column names too. You don't need
\texttt{.iloc{[}{]}} here.

Filtering can also be done with \texttt{.loc{[}{]}}. This uses the row,
column labels (names).

Here we ask for rows with labels (indexes) 1-3, and it gives exactly
that\\
\texttt{.iloc{[}{]}} returned rows with indices 1,2.

\textbf{Author note: This is by far the more useful of the two in my
experience.}

\hypertarget{boolean-filtering}{%
\section{Boolean Filtering}\label{boolean-filtering}}

It's very common to subset a dataframe based on some condition on the
data.

🔑 Note that even though we are filtering rows, we are not using
\texttt{.loc{[}{]}} or \texttt{.iloc{[}{]}} here.

Pandas knows what to do if you pass a boolean structure.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{iris.sepal\_length }\OperatorTok{\textgreater{}=} \FloatTok{7.5}
\end{Highlighting}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{masking}{%
\subsection{Masking}\label{masking}}

Here's an example of \textbf{masking} using boolean conditions passed to
the dataframe selector:

Here are the \textbf{values} for the feature \texttt{sepal\ length}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{iris.sepal\_length.values}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And here are \textbf{the boolean values} generated by applying a
comparison operator to those values:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mask }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ iris.sepal\_length }\OperatorTok{\textgreater{}=} \FloatTok{7.5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mask.values}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The two sets of values have the same shape.

We can now overlay the logical values over the numeric ones and keep
only what is \texttt{True}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{iris.sepal\_length[mask].values}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{working-with-missing-data}{%

\href{https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html}{Details}

We can pass the results of an operation -- for example to peform simple
imputation, we can replace missing values in each column with the median
value of the respective column:

\begin{Shaded}

Important parameters include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{how} : type of merge \{`left', `right', `outer', `inner',
  `cross'\}, default `inner'
\item
  \texttt{on} : names to join on

\href{https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html}{Details}

Create two tables, \texttt{left} and \texttt{right}. Then right join
them on \texttt{key}.\\
Right join means include all records from table on right.\\
The \texttt{key} is used for matching up the records.

Including -1 as one of the dimensions tells numpy: infer this dimension
from the data and the other dimensions.

Example: enforce 3 columns:

This is a narrow table.

It has few columns and many rows.

Columns are types of things, and values in rows are either instances or
subtypes.

This is a wide table.

One column's values are projected onto the feature space (as columns).

The othe column becomes a unique list (as is the feature space).

\hypertarget{the-basic-idea}{%
\section{The Basic Idea}\label{the-basic-idea}}

The usual way that Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is introduced to
students is as a natural way to describe things in the world.

The story told goes something like this:

\textbf{The world consists of a bunch of things.}

These things may be animate or inanimate, but they have two things in
common:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Attributes: qualities, traits, features
\item
  Behaviors: ways of interacting with other things
\end{itemize}

So, anything from an orange to the economy of France are things.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The properties of an orange are its color, weight, species, etc.
\item
  The properties of the economy of France are its GDP, its industrial
  sectors, its rate of unemployment, etc.
\item
  The behaviors of an orange are things like being eaten, or rotting.
\item
  The behaviors of an economy are going into a recession, etc.
\end{itemize}

These things are called \textbf{objects}.

\textbf{All objects that exist are instances of abstract classes.}

Every object that exists is an instance of an abstract class.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A specific orange is an instance of the class of Oranges.
\item
  France's economy is an instance of the class of National Economies.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, toprule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, opacityback=0, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, bottomtitle=1mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, leftrule=.75mm, left=2mm, colback=white, breakable]

The nature of these classes raises an important philosophical question,
but we will not address this here.

\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Classes are organized into trees.}

Classes are organized into tree-like structures.

Specific classes inherit the attributes and behaviors of their parent
and ancestors, although they can override these as well.

So, an organge might have this lineage:

\texttt{Plant\ \textgreater{}\ Magnoliophyta\ \textgreater{}\ Magnoliopsida\ \textgreater{}\ Rosidae\ \textgreater{}\ Sapindales\ \textgreater{}\ Rutaceae\ \textgreater{}\ Citrus\ \textgreater{}\ Valencia\ Orange}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, toprule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, opacityback=0, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, bottomtitle=1mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, leftrule=.75mm, left=2mm, colback=white, breakable]

The idea that the world is organized into a hierarchy of things
descending from some primary substance is ancient. Here is an example
from the European Middle Ages:

\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{topics/../media/Porphyrian_Tree.png}

}

\caption{The Poryphyrian Tree}

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{relationship-to-coding}{%
\section{Relationship to Coding}\label{relationship-to-coding}}

OOP is based on the analogy that code can be organized in this way.

This is because software is often about the world -- we write software
to model things in the world.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For example, if I wanted to write code simulate the traffic pattern of
  a city, I might start by creating a class called Car.
\item
  This Car would have properties, such as its make and model, but also
  behaviors like driving.
\item
  Then, in simulation program, I would create a bunch of Car instances
  and have them do things like drive on streets, etc.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{another-way-to-look-at-it}{%
\section{Another Way to Look at It}\label{another-way-to-look-at-it}}

Now, although this way of looking at OOP is somewhat intuitive, it can
be misleading.

It is great for understanding the data structure that OOP uses.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A tree-like organization of classes
\item
  Classes with attributes and behaviors
\end{itemize}

But the OO pattern is not always used to model things in the world.

Sometimes is just a good way to organize code -- OOP is a data structure
for the data that is code.

In other words, just as we say that dimension can refer to the world or
to the structure of data, so too can an object.

We use OOP to provide structure to our code, regardless of whether it
paints an accurate picture of the world.

\hypertarget{the-trinity}{%
\section{The Trinity}\label{the-trinity}}

OOP theory states that classes exhibit three fundamental properties that
make them powerful:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Encapsulation
\item
  Inheritance
\item
  Polymorphism
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Encapsulation} means that objects are self-contained. They have
their own scope, data, and logic. Ideally, they can be deployed in any
context and be shielded from external states.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Objects are meant to be black boxes to users: they should only be
  interacted with via the methods and attributes provided.
\item
  Nothing else should influence the state of the object except what it
  contains and what is passed to it.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Inheritance} means that classes can be subclasses of other
classes and thereby inherit their ancestor attributes and methods. -
Some programming languages allow only single inheritance -- classes can
have one parent. - Python supports multiple inheritance, but this can be
complicated to use.

\textbf{Polymorphism} means that methods can perform different behaviors
based on the arguments they are passed. - That is, a function can be
defined more than once in a class, as long as it each has a unique
\textbf{signature}. - A signature is the particular pattern of arguments
(parameters) a method has.

Today, we are only going to focus on \textbf{encapsulation} \ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Once upon a time, there was a movement to implement only this concept.
\item
  Microsoft, for example, developed a component-based approach to
  programming, where components are encapsulated unites of code without
  the complexity of inheritance.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{nb-introducing-classes}{%

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{introduction-6}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-6}}

When we work with things and reason about them, we generally think about
their attributes, and what they can do.

For similar things, it can be helpful for group them into
\texttt{objects} such as cars, homes, databases, or logistic regression
models.

A \texttt{class} provides \textbf{a template} for creating an object,
and for working with the object. For the case of the logistic regression
model, it has \texttt{attributes} like:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  weights
\item
  an optional intercept term
\item
  the maximum number of iterations
\end{itemize}

These \textbf{attributes} help describe the object (they give the
object's \textbf{state}).

The logistic regression model has functionality such as: - the
optimization routine used in training - a prediction function

The behavior, or functionality, is supported by \textbf{methods}, which
are functions included in the class.

There are \textbf{tremendous benefits to programming with objects}, or
object-oriented programming (OOP), such as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Objects are \textbf{natural} ways of defining, grouping,
  communicating, and thinking about things
\item
  Objects are convenient for \textbf{packaging together the data and
  functionality}. It concisely says: what is in this thing, and what
  does it do?
\item
  It is simple to create as \textbf{many copies} of the object as you'd
  like
\item
  For more complex objects, they can take on all the attributes and
  methods of the simpler object. this is called \texttt{inheritance}.
\end{itemize}

Ok, let's look at examples, starting with a very small, simple class.\\
The class contains: - a name (Ferrari458) - a docstring for a quick
description - an attribute, which is number of cylinders in the engine -
a method

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ Ferrari458:}
    \CommentTok{"""this is a Ferrari 458 object"""}
\NormalTok{    cylinders }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{8}

    \KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ print\_origin(}\VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{):}
        \ControlFlowTok{return} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}I was built in Italy!\textquotesingle{}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can learn about the class by printing the docstring:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Ferrari458.\_\_doc\_\_}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can also get detailed help like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{help}\NormalTok{(Ferrari458)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Next, we create an object from the class (also called an
\texttt{instance} of the class).\\
It is called like a function with no parameters. The process is called
\texttt{instantiation.}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{myferrari }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ Ferrari458()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We show the number of cylinders by using the \texttt{object.attribute}
format:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{myferrari.cylinders}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Then we call its method \texttt{print\_origin} to learn where this sweet
machine was built.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{myferrari.print\_origin()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

As a convention, methods take \texttt{self} as their first argument.
Methods can use \texttt{self.attribute} to extract their attributes.\\
Here is an example, with method \texttt{get\_cylinders}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ Ferrari458\_v2:}
    \CommentTok{"""this is a Ferrari 458 object"""}
\NormalTok{    cylinders }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{8}

    \KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ print\_origin(}\VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{):}
        \ControlFlowTok{return} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}I was built in Italy!\textquotesingle{}}

    \KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ get\_cylinders(}\VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{):}
        \ControlFlowTok{return} \VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{.cylinders}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{myferrari }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ Ferrari458\_v2()}
\NormalTok{myferrari.get\_cylinders()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{the-.__init__-method}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{The \texttt{.\_\_init\_\_()}
method}{The .\_\_init\_\_() method}}\label{the-.__init__-method}}

There is a special function called \texttt{\_\_init\_\_} that will
\textbf{initialize} objects for you when you create them.

Use it to supply more context-dependent information about your instance.

Let's look at another version of the class with \textbf{init}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ Ferrari458\_v3:}
    \CommentTok{"""this is a Ferrari 458 object"""}
\NormalTok{    cylinders }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{8}
    
    \KeywordTok{def} \FunctionTok{\_\_init\_\_}\NormalTok{(}\VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{, color):}
        \VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{.color }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ color}

    \KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ print\_origin(}\VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{):}
        \ControlFlowTok{return} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}I was built in Italy!\textquotesingle{}}

    \KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ get\_color(}\VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{):}
        \ControlFlowTok{return} \VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{.color}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

By adding the \texttt{\_\_init\_\_} function, we can create objects if
we pass the number of cylinders.

If we don't pass this parameter, there will be an error.

This is because we did not define a default value for the color argument
in our initialization method.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#ferr1 = Ferrari458\_v3()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This works:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ferr1 }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ Ferrari458\_v3(}\StringTok{"red"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can access the initialized attribute using the dot operator, just as
if it were declared at the top of the class:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ferr1.color}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Or we can call the accessor method that we created.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ferr1.get\_color()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that even though we initialized the car object with ``red'', we can
always change it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ferr1.color }\OperatorTok{=} \StringTok{"Cobalt"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ferr1.get\_color()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{the-meaning-of-self}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{The Meaning of
\texttt{self}}{The Meaning of self}}\label{the-meaning-of-self}}

Note the presence of an argument and variable called
\textbf{\texttt{self} in the method definitions}. - This stands for the
intantiated object itself.

So, when you create an object like so:

\begin{itemize}
\item
\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{foo }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ Foo()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\item
  \texttt{foo} is represented in the class definition as \texttt{self}.
\end{itemize}

If you want your method to access the other attributes and methods in an
object, \textbf{you need to put self as its first argument}. - Note that
when you use the method with an instance, you don't pass the object name
as an argument - The object name is passed implicitly by Python, since
it knows which object called the methid

You can use any valid name you want for the name of the object itself,
but the convention is to use \texttt{self}.

Note that \texttt{self} is \textbf{only used within the methods} of a
class, not outside of it. - Like functions, they don't know what's
outside of them, nor does the containing code know what's inside of
them. - The \texttt{self} variable is the mechanism that allows methods
to share data without having to pass and return a bunch of variables.

Think of \texttt{self} as a \textbf{data structure that stores the
program itself} - In this sense, it's similar to \textbf{recursion}: A
class definition contains a reference to itself! - But remember, the
class definition is not a thing -- it's a template. - \texttt{self} is
just a pronoun that allows an instance to access it's own state.

\hypertarget{summary-1}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary-1}}

An \textbf{cobject} is a self-contained bundle of \textbf{methods and
attributes}. * Methods are basically functions. * Attributes are
basically variables.

A \textbf{class} definition is a \textbf{template} for creating objects.
* Objects are \textbf{class instances}. * Classes are \textbf{onbject
types}.

Objects have \textbf{their own scope}, like functions. * They are meant
to \textbf{exchange information} with their environment only through
accessing attributes and calling methods

When objects are first created, \textbf{they often expect to have data
passed to them}. * This is called \textbf{initializing} the object. *
These data are handled internally by the \texttt{.\_\_init\_\_()}
method. * Data that are passed this way can be \textbf{overridden} by
accessing the attributes they assigned to.

The methods of a class begin with \texttt{self} as the first argument. *
This stands for \textbf{the instance itself}. * \textbf{All methods and
attributes are avaible} to all other methods in the object
\textbf{through the \texttt{self} object}.

If a method does not have \texttt{self} as its first argument, it cannot
access the internal state or methods of the object. * The internal state
is just the attributes and their current values. * These are called
\textbf{static} methods. * Static methods are useful in providing
functions to the environment in which their containing object is
instantiated.

\textbf{There is a lot more to the subject, but this is good enough to
get started!}

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%
\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

The OOP approach handles scoping issues as well as data management.

Notice how the dictionary is replaced by the object.

Not only does it provide a place to store the data, it also provides a
schema for it: * You don't need to remember what keys to put in the
\texttt{data} dictionary of method 2. The object specifies them.

Notice also that we don't pass arguments to the object as we do with
functions (although we can).

We assign values to attributes directly.

\textbf{Can you think of any other advantages or disadvantages?}

  When saving to a file:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If only one class, use a lower case name of the class
  \item

Attributes}\label{nb-understanding-static-attributes}}

\textbf{Purpose}: To demonstrate how class and instance attributes are
related to each other.

\hypertarget{a-simple-example}{%
\section{A Simple Example}\label{a-simple-example}}

We define a class with one attribute.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ Foo(): x }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We create an instance of the class.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{foo1 }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ Foo()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We demonstrate that the class defines the value for the instance.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{foo1.x, Foo.x}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We demonstrate that the instance changes if the class does.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Foo.x }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{foo1.x, Foo.x}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now we override the class attribute with the local.

This is similar to how we can override a global with a local.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{foo1.x }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{3}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{foo1.x, Foo.x}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We demonstrate that the instance attribute is now unaffected by the
global.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Foo.x }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{foo1.x, Foo.x}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{a-cool-trick}{%
\section{A Cool Trick}\label{a-cool-trick}}

You can define an empty class and add attributes as you go.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ Bar:}
    \ControlFlowTok{pass}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{bar1 }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ Bar()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{bar1.x }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{bar1.x}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Since we defined an instance attribute, the class remains unchanged.

So, this will throw an error:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Bar.x}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We define another instance, but this time we add an attribute to the
class.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{bar2 }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ Bar()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Bar.x }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Notice how the instance has the new attribute, even though it was added
to the class after the instance was created.

\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{bar2.x, Bar.x}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{mutable-statics}{%
\section{Mutable Statics}\label{mutable-statics}}

There is an interesting gotcha regarding static attributes in Python.

Lists and other mutable data structures can be static and yet have their
values modified by instances.

This is kind of weird.

To demonstrate, we define a class with two instance variables, one a
scalar and one a list.

We define a method to alter the value of each.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\#| tags: []}
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ WithStatic():}
    
\NormalTok{    foo }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{0}  \CommentTok{\# The value is NOT affected by instances}
\NormalTok{    bar }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [] }\CommentTok{\# The values ARE afftected by instances}
    
    \KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ add\_one(}\VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{):}
        \VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{.foo }\OperatorTok{+=} \DecValTok{1}       \CommentTok{\# This does NOT affect the static attribute}
        \VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{.bar.append(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)  }\CommentTok{\# This DOES affect the static attribute, only its values}
        
    \KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ replace\_bar(}\VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{, new\_list }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ []):}
        \VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{.bar }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ new\_list }\CommentTok{\# This replaces the list itself}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We define a function to compare an instance and its class to see how
static attributes are affected by instances.

Notice the \texttt{getattr()} method -- this allows you to get the value
of an attribute using a literal value for the attribute name.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ my\_test (my\_class, my\_instance, my\_vars}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{[]):}
    \ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ my\_var }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ my\_vars:}
\NormalTok{        i }\OperatorTok{=} \BuiltInTok{getattr}\NormalTok{(my\_instance, my\_var)}
\NormalTok{        c }\OperatorTok{=} \BuiltInTok{getattr}\NormalTok{(my\_class, my\_var)}
        \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialStringTok{f\textquotesingle{}i.}\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{my\_var}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{ =\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, i)}
        \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialStringTok{f\textquotesingle{}c.}\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{my\_var}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{ =\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, c)}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We define an instance and compare the values.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{with\_static1 }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ WithStatic()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_test(WithStatic, with\_static1, [}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}foo\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}bar\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now we increment the attributes and see the results.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{with\_static1.add\_one()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The method does disconnect the instance \texttt{foo} from the class
\texttt{foo}.

But it does not disconnect the instance \texttt{bar} from the class
\texttt{bar}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_test(WithStatic, with\_static1, [}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}foo\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}bar\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We do it again to drive the point home.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{with\_static1.add\_one()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_test(WithStatic, with\_static1, [}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}foo\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}bar\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now, let's replace list itself in the instance.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{with\_static1.replace\_bar()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ i }\KeywordTok{in} \BuiltInTok{range}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{):}
\NormalTok{    with\_static1.add\_one()}
\NormalTok{    my\_test(WithStatic, with\_static1, [}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}foo\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}bar\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We define a second instance.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{with\_static2 }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ WithStatic()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The new instance has the original value of \texttt{foo}.

However, it starts of with the modified value of \texttt{bar} before it
was replaced.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_test(WithStatic, with\_static2, [}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}foo\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}bar\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We do it a few more times to drive the point home.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ i }\KeywordTok{in} \BuiltInTok{range}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{):}
\NormalTok{    with\_static2.add\_one()}
\NormalTok{    my\_test(WithStatic, with\_static2, [}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}foo\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}bar\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{])}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Testing and Verification (see next Module item)

\hypertarget{testing-and-verification}{%
\chapter{Testing and Verification}\label{testing-and-verification}}

Definitions

Before we get started, let's review some definitions.

verification

Shows that the code meets the requirement specification~Example: You
verify that I wrote the program you asked me to write.

validation

Shows that the code meets the real requirements Example: You show that
the program is a valid solution to the user's problem.

quality

Suggests that validations falls on a scale, not a black-and-white idea.
Defining the scale can be difficult.

specification

A precise and detailed statement about the properties some things must
have

Design specification: exact instructions for how to build something

Requirements specifications: exact statements about what should be built

Specifications are very important. Not only are they used to guide the
creation of the project, but also they're{~}vital for program testing
and verification. That is, if you don't have specifications for the
product, you cannot verify that you're doing the right thing. Likewise,
if behavior is not defined, then it becomes difficult to know what
is{~}incorrect{~}behavior.

Edsger Dijkstra{~}was a famous computer scientist and A. M. Turing award
winner. This quotation by him is a great one and very true. Even if you
write a test suite of carefully crafted test cases, and if they all run
and pass, it doesn't mean that no further bugs exist.

It is much easier to prove the existence of something than to disprove
the existence of something.{~}This realization should motivate us to
learn how to create carefully crafted unit tests so that we can test as
much as we can.

``Program testing can effectively show the presence of bugs but is
hopeless for showing their absence.''--Edsger Dijkstra

Formal Verification

Formal verification involves proof. There are three types:

Hand-written, hand-checked

Hand-written, machine-checked (proof-carrying code)

Machine-written, machine-checked (static analysis)

None of them are very widely used yet, but the latter two are increasing
in popularity. Formal verification is complex, difficult, and takes a
great deal of effort.

Empirical Testing

Instead of formal verification, correctness is demonstrated through
empirical testing. Empirical testing shows it works on several inputs.
In general, testing is:

A lot easier than proof

A lot harder (and more involved) than writing code~

Types of Empirical Testing

There are many kinds of testing, but we will focus on unit testing in
this module. Two other kinds of testing are integration and acceptance
(beta) testing, which are out of the scope of this lesson. See below for
a short description.

Unit Testing

Write code that tests the smallest possible units of the spec (must
attempt to test every flow path). The programmer does unit testing as
part of the coding process.

Integration Testing

Test that units work together.

Acceptance Testing (Beta Testing)

Give product to real users to try it out.

Flow Path

A flow path is a unique execution sequence through a program unit. It is
done as part of the coding process by the programmer. A good set of test
data makes sure every possible path is followed (tests every possible
behavior). Because loops are able to execute an arbitrarily large number
of times, and because there ~potentially are an infinite number of
inputs into a program, there are virtually an infinite number of flow
paths. Exhaustive testing is usually impossible. However, we can
overcome these odds by being clever about the kinds of tests that we
write. We'll also learn about equivalence classes, which also help us
overcome this hurdle.

Example of code showing various flow paths. For example, starting at
Stmt1, then the condition of the while loop (C1) is true, so that takes
us to the condition of the if statement (C2) but maybe this is false, so
we end up in the else portion, Stmt3. This is an example of a flow path
starting at Stmt1 and ending up at Stmt3. In other words, there are many
paths through a given program.

\begin{quote}
All happy families are alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its
own way.\\
-- Leo Tolstoy, \emph{Anna Karenina}, 1878.
\end{quote}

There are two ways that programs can succeed of fail:

They can meet or not meet the motiving \textbf{requirements} for the
code. - Does it do what is is supposed to do? - Does it add value to a
process? - Is it ethical? Does it do harm?

They can \textbf{work or not work}: - Does the run at all? - Is the code
brittle or buggy? - Is it sensitive to contextual factors like bad user
input or a bad database connection? - Does the code work but produce
incorrect outcomes?

These lead to \textbf{two practices}: * Strategic: \textbf{Project
management} * Tactical: \textbf{Testing and debugging}

Today, we will focus on some concepts and tools for the latter. * We
want to know whether our code is \textbf{working or not}. * We want to
know if our code is of a \textbf{high quality}.

\textbf{Approaches to quality} * Through good \textbf{design} * Throigh
principled \textbf{testing}

\textbf{Some design principles} * Favor the \textbf{simple over the
complex} * Don't confuse the easy with the simple! * Invest in
\textbf{data design} to simplify algorithm design * Write
\textbf{literate code} * Given a choice, use tools that are
\textbf{documented} and have a \textbf{user community} * Many other
things :-)

\textbf{Some testing activities} * Syntax checking * Debugging * Ad hoc
testing * Unit-testing * User testing

\textbf{Some concepts} * Beware of \textbf{silent failures} * Testing
for \textbf{the absence of bugs} is impossible - Like Popper's concept
of falsifiability

\hypertarget{tools-and-concepts-for-testing}{%
\section{Tools and Concepts for
Testing}\label{tools-and-concepts-for-testing}}

Programming languages offer many tools for testing.

These include mechanisms to define and capture errors in code.

We call these errors \textbf{exceptions}. - An exception is an event
that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal
flow of the program's instructions.

We call we call dealing with these errors \textbf{exception handling}. -
When a Python script encounters a code failure, it raises an exception.

\hypertarget{pythons-tools}{%

\textbf{Exceptions} - A Python \textbf{object} that represents an error

\hypertarget{errors-and-exceptions}{%
\section{Errors and Exceptions}\label{errors-and-exceptions}}

A common technical interview question: Explain the difference between an
\textbf{error} and an \textbf{exception}.

An \textbf{error} is a serious problem that a reasonable application
should not try to catch.\\
An error will stop execution. It means the code if broken and needs to
be rewritten.

An \textbf{exception} is an issue that is expected or known to occur
(e.g., division by zero).\\
Software must handle exceptions. For example, one bad row of data
shouldn't bring down the application.

\hypertarget{some-common-built-in-exceptions}{%
\section{Some Common Built-in
Exceptions}\label{some-common-built-in-exceptions}}

Python comes with a number of predefined exceptions.

Libraries introduce new ones, too.

They used in \texttt{raise} statement by the authors of programs when a
possible error is anticipated.

Here are some common examples.

\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{exception-handling-with-tryexcept}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Exception Handling with
\texttt{try/except}}{Exception Handling with try/except}}\label{exception-handling-with-tryexcept}}

We use \texttt{try/except} blocks to handle exceptions in our code.

These blocks work as follows: * The \texttt{try} block will contain a
statement. * If the statement fails, the the flow goes to the
\texttt{except} block. * The exception block will have code to handle
the error, rather than halting the program.

The process is very similar to \texttt{if/then}: * \textbf{If} there is
an \textbf{error}, \textbf{then} raise an \textbf{excpetion}.

Multiple \texttt{except} statements may be given, to handle specific
exceptions.

Below, we give a catch-all \texttt{except} for any kind of exception.

An \textbf{excpetion} is a mistake that will halt the execution of code.
* For example, trying to access a dictionary key that does not exit. *
Or, a database connection fails. * Very often, execeptions are caused by
an external dependency failing, such as another system or the user.

Let's try referencing a variable that doesn't exist with no exception
handling.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(a)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now let's try referencing a variable that doesn't exist with a
\texttt{try/except} block to handle the exception.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{try}\NormalTok{:}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(a)}
\ControlFlowTok{except}\NormalTok{:}
   \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"caught an exception"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{assert-statements}{%
\section{Assert Statements}\label{assert-statements}}

Another to catch errors before they happen is to test if computations
turned out as expected.

We use \texttt{assert} to verify an expression is True.\\
- if expression is True, nothing happens. - if expression is False,
Python raises an \texttt{AssertionError} exception.

Assert statements have the followinf syntax:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{assert}\NormalTok{ Expression[, Arguments]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

where \texttt{{[},\ Arguments{]}} denotes optional arguments.

For example, let's say a program is expecting three arguments to be
passed from the command line.

The variable \texttt{num\_args} counts the arguments.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{num\_args }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{3}

\ControlFlowTok{assert}\NormalTok{ num\_args }\OperatorTok{==} \DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"number of arguments must be 3!"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{assert} evaluates to True, and things proceed normally
without exception.

If we change \texttt{num\_args\ =\ 4} this will throw an
\texttt{AssertionError} with the provided message.

The program then stops.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{num\_args }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{4}

\ControlFlowTok{assert}\NormalTok{ num\_args }\OperatorTok{==} \DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"number of arguments must be 3!"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If the \texttt{assert} is not given a message, it throws
\texttt{AssertionError:}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{num\_args }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{4}

\ControlFlowTok{assert}\NormalTok{ num\_args }\OperatorTok{==} \DecValTok{3}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{try}\NormalTok{:}
    \ControlFlowTok{assert}\NormalTok{ num\_args }\OperatorTok{==} \DecValTok{3}
\ControlFlowTok{except}\NormalTok{:}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Got an error"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{try}\NormalTok{:}
    \ControlFlowTok{assert}\NormalTok{ num\_args }\OperatorTok{==} \DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Number of arguments must be 3!"}
\ControlFlowTok{except} \PreprocessorTok{AssertionError} \ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ e:}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{raise}{%

Exceptions can be \textbf{raised}, too.

\hypertarget{unit-testing}{%
\section{Unit Testing}\label{unit-testing}}

Unit testing is a testing technique in which \textbf{individual modules
are tested} to determine if there are any issues by the developer
himself.

It is concerned with \textbf{functional correctness} of the stand-alone
modules.

The main aim is to \textbf{isolate each unit} of the system to identify,
analyze and fix the defects.

These units are typicallly functions and methods.

\hypertarget{benefits-of-unit-testing}{%
\section{Benefits of Unit Testing}\label{benefits-of-unit-testing}}

Developers can work in a \textbf{predictable} way on developing code.

Developers can \textbf{write their own unit tests}.

You can get \textbf{a rapid response} for testing small changes

Also:

Reduces \textbf{defects in the newly developed features} or reduces bugs
when changing the existing functionality.

Reduces \textbf{cost of testing}, since defects are captured in very
early phase.

\textbf{Improves design} and allows better refactoring of code.

Testing in Python is a huge topic and can come with a lot of complexity,
but it doesn't need to be hard. You can get started creating simple
tests for your application in a few easy steps and then build on it from
there.

\hypertarget{the-unittest-framework}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{The \texttt{unittest}
Framework}{The unittest Framework}}\label{the-unittest-framework}}

One of the popular unit testing frameworks is Unittest. It is works well
and is easy to use.

There are other tools, though -- here's
\href{https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/python-testing-frameworks/}{a
comparison of 6 Python testing frameworks}.

\hypertarget{the-basic-idea-1}{%
\section{The Basic Idea}\label{the-basic-idea-1}}

The Unittest framework provides you with \textbf{a bunch of
\texttt{assert} methods}, which are essentially wrappers around Python's
built-in \texttt{assert} function.

The basic idea is to \textbf{write functions that test other functions}
by using these assert methods \textbf{instead of peppering your code}
with them.

Unittest provides \textbf{many assert methods} -- see this
\href{https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Python_unittest_Assertions.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index}{cheat
sheet} for more.

We will focus on three: * \texttt{assertTrue()} * \texttt{assertFalse()}
* \texttt{assertEqual()}

\hypertarget{the-basic-pattern}{%
\section{The Basic Pattern}\label{the-basic-pattern}}

The Unittest framework works as follows:

\textbf{Choose} on a method or class that you want to test.

\textbf{Create a class} that is a subclass of
\texttt{unittest.TestCase}.

In that class \textbf{write methods} that are designed to test the
behavior of methods in the code you want to test.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  These \textbf{test methods} focus on one behavior of one method (or
  function).
\item
  There can be \textbf{many test methods} for each target method.
\item
  Each test method name must be prefixed by \textbf{\texttt{test\_}}.
\item
  Tests are executing in alphabetical order, so name them in the order
  you want them executed.
\item
  Each test makes use of an \textbf{assert method}. These methods
  typically compare \textbf{expected} with \textbf{actual} methods and
  return \texttt{False} if they don't match and \texttt{True} if they
  do.
\item
  You always want tests to pass, so if you want to test if something
  breaks, you return \texttt{True} for a \texttt{False} condition.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Run} the script and see the results.

\textbf{Update} the script as you create new methods or refactor
existing ones.

In Python, a \textbf{module} can be a file containing Python definitions
and statements.

The file name is the module name with the suffix \texttt{.py} appended.

Inside the file, the module's name is available as the value of the
global variable \texttt{\_\_name\_\_}.

For instance, let's say we have a file called \texttt{fibo.py} with the
following code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\# Fibonacci numbers module}

\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ fib(n):    }\CommentTok{\# write Fibonacci series up to n}
\NormalTok{    a, b }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}
    \ControlFlowTok{while}\NormalTok{ a }\OperatorTok{\textless{}}\NormalTok{ n:}
        \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(a, end}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{} \textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{        a, b }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ b, a}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{b}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{()}

\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ fib2(n):   }\CommentTok{\# return Fibonacci series up to n}
\NormalTok{    a, b }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}
\NormalTok{    result }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ []}
    \ControlFlowTok{while}\NormalTok{ a }\OperatorTok{\textless{}}\NormalTok{ n:}
\NormalTok{        result.append(a)}
\NormalTok{        a, b }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ b, a}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{b}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ result}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can import it into this notebook and get it's filename.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ fibo}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fibo.}\VariableTok{\_\_name\_\_}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And here is how we interact with the file as a module:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fibo.fib(}\DecValTok{1000}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fibo.fib2(}\DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{aside-on-namespaces}{%
\section{Aside on Namespaces}\label{aside-on-namespaces}}

You can see that a python \textbf{module} acts as a single
\textbf{namespace}, which is used to organize a collection of values:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  functions
\item
  constants
\item
  class definitions
\item
  really any old value
\end{itemize}

A namespace is a collection of currently defined names being used by a
program.

You can think of its as a Python dictionary in which the keys are the
object names and the values are the objects themselves.

It's a way of making sure variable and function names do not collide or
get confused with each other.

Python has four namespaces: * \textbf{Built-In}: Contains the names of
all of Python's built-in objects. See \texttt{dir(\_\_builtins\_\_)} *
\textbf{Global}: Contains any names defined at the level of the main
program. A global namespace is also created for any module that your
program imports. See \texttt{globals()}. * \textbf{Enclosing}: The
namespaces of a function for any functions defined within that function.
* \textbf{Local}: Contains any names defined in a function.

Namespaces are related to \textbf{scope}. To know the context in which a
name has meaning, Python searches namespaces from the inside out.

\begin{verbatim}
L -> E -> G -> B
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{packages}{%
\section{Packages}\label{packages}}

\textbf{A package is a directory} that may contain other modules.

For a directory to be a package, it must contain an
\texttt{\_\_init\_\_.py} file.

The \texttt{\_\_init\_\_.py} can be \textbf{totally empty} or it can
have some Python code in it. We'll see why you would do that below.

It it will contain other python files or other package directories, too.

Here an example directory structure of a package that contains a
package:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\# EXAMPLE 1 }
\ExtensionTok{a\_package\_dir}
    \ExtensionTok{\_\_init\_\_.py}
    \ExtensionTok{module\_a.py}
    \ExtensionTok{a\_sub\_package\_dir}
        \ExtensionTok{\_\_init\_\_.py}
        \ExtensionTok{module\_b.py}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

At a minimum, all you need to do have is this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\# EXAMPLE 2}
\ExtensionTok{a\_package\_dir}
    \ExtensionTok{\_\_init\_\_.py}
    \ExtensionTok{module\_a.py}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

However, \textbf{ideally}, if you want to have your package
\textbf{installed}, you'd do this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\# EXAMPLE 3}
\ExtensionTok{src}
    \ExtensionTok{a\_package\_dir}
        \ExtensionTok{\_\_init\_\_.py}
        \ExtensionTok{module\_a.py}
\ExtensionTok{tests}
    \ExtensionTok{...}
\ExtensionTok{setup.py} \CommentTok{\# Or pyproject.toml }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that we put our package in the source directory \texttt{src} and
added the setup file \texttt{setup.py}, with the note that it can
replaced by \texttt{pyproject.toml}.

\includegraphics{notebooks/M09_PythonModules/19BFA18D-1187-43E1-9E0E-820C782C352C.jpg}

\hypertarget{packages-and-namespaces}{%
\section{Packages and Namespaces}\label{packages-and-namespaces}}

Packages structure Python's \textbf{module namespace} by setting up
\textbf{dotted module names.}

For example, the module name \texttt{A.B} designates a submodule named
\texttt{B} in a package named \texttt{A}.

The use of dotted module names saves the authors of multi-module
packages like NumPy or Pillow from having to worry about each other's
module names.

\hypertarget{importing-packages-and-modules}{%
\section{Importing Packages and
Modules}\label{importing-packages-and-modules}}

So, given the above directory and file structure, within a Python file
you can:

\begin{verbatim}
import a_package
\end{verbatim}

This will run any code in \texttt{a\_package/\_\_init\_\_.py}.

So, any variable or function names defined in the
\texttt{\_\_init\_\_.py} will be available like this:

\begin{verbatim}
a_package.a_name
\end{verbatim}

However, no \textbf{modules} will be imported unless explicity commanded
to.

For example:

\begin{verbatim}
a_package.module_a
\end{verbatim}

will not be imported.

To get modules, you need to explicitly import them:

\begin{verbatim}
import a_package.module_a
\end{verbatim}

You will have noticed this in working with well-known libraries (bundles
of packages) like Scikit Learn.

\hypertarget{the-module-search-path}{%
\section{The module search path}\label{the-module-search-path}}

How does Python know where to find modules?

The interpreter keeps a list of all the places that it looks for modules
or packages when you do an import. It is stored in the \texttt{sys}
module.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ sys}
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ p }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ sys.path:}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{ p}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can edit that list to add or remove paths to let python find modules
on a new place.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sys.path.append(some\_local\_dir)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Remember that every module has a \texttt{\_\_file\_\_} name that points
to the path it lives in.

This lets you add paths relative to where you are, etc.

There is, of course, a lot more to this topic than what's covered here.

We've covered what you need to know to get started.

See \href{https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html\#packages}{the
official docs on modules} for more depth.

\hypertarget{nb-more-on-classes-and-globals}{%
\chapter{NB: More on Classes and
Globals}\label{nb-more-on-classes-and-globals}}

\hypertarget{class-and-globals}{%
\section{Class and Globals}\label{class-and-globals}}

We experiment to see if classes can see the globals of their surrounding
environment.

We already know that functions can.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ Test:}
    
    \CommentTok{\# x has not been declared within the class }
    \CommentTok{\# or any of its methods}
    
    \KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ static\_test():}
        \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(x)}
        
    \KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ method\_test(}\VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{):}
        \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(x)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{try}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{    Test.static\_test()}
\ControlFlowTok{except} \PreprocessorTok{NameError} \ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ e:}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(e)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{t }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ Test()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\NormalTok{    t.method\_test()}
\ControlFlowTok{except} \PreprocessorTok{NameError} \ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ e:}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(e)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

So, global variables are \textbf{also visible within classes}.

The class can see the globals, even though \texttt{x} was defined after
the class definition.

So, \textbf{the class learns about its environment when it is called},
not defined.

But what about imported classes and functions?

\section{Why Build a Package?}\label{why-build-a-package}}

You package code in order to add it to your python system for general
use, and to share it with others.

It's easy to do. There are a bunch of nifty tools that help you build,
install and distribute packages.

It's also just good to have well organized code. This applies to how to
organize your programs internally, and externally as files and
directories.

\hypertarget{what-is-a-package}{%
\section{What is a Package?}\label{what-is-a-package}}

Again: \textbf{A collection of modules} (python files) along with: * the
\textbf{documentation} * the \textbf{tests} * any \textbf{top-level
scripts} * any \textbf{data files} required * instructions and scripts
to \textbf{build and install} it

\hypertarget{what-does-it-mean-to-build-your-package}{%
\section{What does it mean to build your
Package?}\label{what-does-it-mean-to-build-your-package}}

To build your own package, you of course need some Python files you want
to deploy.

Then you create the following: 1. Create the basic package structure,
such as \texttt{EXAMPLE\ 3} above. 2. Write a \texttt{setup.py} using a
package tool (see below).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\# EXAMPLE 3}
\ExtensionTok{src}
    \ExtensionTok{a\_package\_dir}
        \ExtensionTok{\_\_init\_\_.py}

\ExtensionTok{tests}
    \ExtensionTok{...}
\ExtensionTok{setup.py} \CommentTok{\# Or pyproject.toml }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{about-setup.py}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{About
\texttt{setup.py}}{About setup.py}}\label{about-setup.py}}

Your \texttt{setup.py} file describes your package, and tells the
packaging tool how to package, build, and install it.

It is Python code, so you can add anything custom you need to it.

In the simple case, it is basically a configuration files with keys and
values.

What does \texttt{setup.py} contain?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Version \& package metadata
\item
  List of packages to include
\item
  List of other files to include
\item
  List of dependencies
\item
  List of extensions to be compiled
\end{itemize}

\textbf{About \texttt{pyproject.toml}}

For a lot reasons that beyond the scope of this document,
\texttt{setup.py} is being superceded by the use of
\texttt{pyproject.toml} files to store setup configuration information.
However, for now we're going to stick to the old school approach.

As mentioned about, the main content of basic setup files is
configuraton information. The keys that you should include in your
projects are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{name}: A string of the package name as title, not a filename.
\item
  \textbf{version}: A string of the version number expression, typically
  using the \texttt{MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH} pattern. See
  \href{https://semver.org/}{Semantic Versioning} for more information.
\item
  \textbf{author}: A string with the creator's name.
\item
  \textbf{author\_email}: A string with the creator's email address.
\item
  \textbf{packages}: A list of strings of package directories in the
  project.
\item
  \textbf{url}: A string of the URL to the code repo.
\item
  \textbf{license}: A string of the license file name.
\item
  \textbf{description}: A string with a short blurb of the project.
\item
  \textbf{long\_description}: A link to a longer description. Can do
  something like
  \texttt{open(\textquotesingle{}README.txt\textquotesingle{}).read()}.
\item
  \textbf{install\_requires}: A list of strings of external libraries
  that the project requires.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{python-packaging-tools}{%
\subsection{Python packaging tools}\label{python-packaging-tools}}

In writing \texttt{setup.py}, you need to use a packaging tool. Notice
that we've imported the \texttt{setuptools} library. * The package tool
\texttt{distutils} is included with Python, but it is not recommended. *
Instead, use \texttt{setuptools}, a third party tool that extends
\texttt{distutils} and is used in most modern Python installations.

to your \texttt{\_\_init\_\_.py} file.

\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{from}\NormalTok{ demo\_package2.module2 }\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ welcome2}

Method arguments and Class Attributes

Understanding Modules and Packages

Modules

A module is a single namespace with many possible values (functions,
classes, constants, etc.)

Usually corresponds to a file.

All modules have a name.

{Python has only one type of }{module}{ object.}

A Package is just a module that may contain other modules (or packages).

It is module with a {\textbf{path}} attribute.

{Packages}{ organize modules into a named hierarchy}.

Packages : modules :: directories : files

Usually corresponds to a directory with with an {\textbf{init}.py} file
in it.

There are two kinds of packages (as of 3.3)

Regular packages are traditional (2 and up to 3.2), they are a directory
with an {\textbf{init}.py} file. They are dependent on the file system.

Namespace packages are composed of portions. They do not have an
\textbf{init}.py file. Portions can be anywhere. They are not dependent
on the file system. They may be virtual.

Import statements bring modules into modules. Combines two operations:

Searches for named module.

Binds results to local name, i.e.~the fully qualified path or an alias.

Compiles and runs the files and packages it imports.

Some general ideas

You can think of a module as a supplemental file relative to a top-level
program or script.

{Module files generally don't do anything when run directly -- they are
used by other files.}

{When modules are imported, their elements are called }{attributes}

Imports execute {\textbf{init}.py} files from the context of the
directory of execution. Think of this as the project directory.

File and directory names should follow variable and function naming
conventions since they will be used to create the names used in the
importing program.

{Global scope }is always the file enclosing it, regardless of which
module it is ultimately called from.

\hypertarget{installing-and-loading-packages}{%
\subsection{Installing and Loading
Packages}\label{installing-and-loading-packages}}

Packages need to be installed once.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DocumentationTok{\#\# install.packages("tm")  }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can also install thing using the Package window.

Once they are installed, you import them with the \texttt{library()}
function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(tm)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Loading required package: NLP
\end{verbatim}

Note that the library name is quoted in when installing, but not when
using \texttt{library}.

\item
  Syntax loosely follows traditional \texttt{C}-style

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Braces} \texttt{\{} and \texttt{\}} are used to form blocks.
  \item
    \textbf{Semi-colons} are used optionally to end statements, required
    if on same line.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Assignments} are made with \texttt{\textless{}-} or
  \texttt{-\textgreater{}}
\item
  \textbf{Dots} \texttt{.} have no special meaning -- they are not
  operators.
\item
  Single and double \textbf{quotes} have the same meaning, but double
  quotes tend to be preferred.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Use single quotes if you expect your string to contain double
    quotes.
  \item
    Backslash escape applies to R strings, although since there are no
    raw strings -- Python's \texttt{r"\ "} -- we often have to supply
    double backslashes in regular expressions.\\
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{r-data-types}{%
\section{R Data Types}\label{r-data-types}}

There are several basic R data types.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Numeric
\item
  Integer
\item
  Complex
\item
  Logical
\item
  Character
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{numeric}{%
\subsection{Numeric}\label{numeric}}

Decimal values are called ``numerics'' in R.

It is the \textbf{default} computational data type.

If we assign a decimal value to a variable x, x will be of numeric type:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FloatTok{10.5}       \CommentTok{\# assign a decimal value }
\NormalTok{x              }\CommentTok{\# print the value of x }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 10.5
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(x)      }\CommentTok{\# print the class name of x }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "numeric"
\end{verbatim}

Eve if we assign an integer to a variable k, it is will still be saved
as a numeric value.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{k }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{1}
\NormalTok{k              }\CommentTok{\# print the value of k }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(k)       }\CommentTok{\# print the class name of k }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "numeric"
\end{verbatim}

That k is not an integer can be confirmed with \texttt{is.integer()}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{is.integer}\NormalTok{(k)  }\CommentTok{\# is k an integer? }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] FALSE
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{integers}{%
\subsection{Integers}\label{integers}}

To create an integer variable in R, we use \texttt{as.integer()}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{y }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{as.integer}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{) }
\NormalTok{y              }\CommentTok{\# print the value of y }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 3
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(y)       }\CommentTok{\# print the class name of y }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "integer"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{is.integer}\NormalTok{(y)  }\CommentTok{\# is y an integer? }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] TRUE
\end{verbatim}

We can also declare an integer by appending an \texttt{L} suffix.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{y }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ 3L }
\FunctionTok{is.integer}\NormalTok{(y)  }\CommentTok{\# is y an integer? }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] TRUE
\end{verbatim}

We can coerce, or cast, a numeric value into an integer with
\texttt{as.integer()}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{as.integer}\NormalTok{(}\FloatTok{3.14}\NormalTok{)    }\CommentTok{\# coerce a numeric value }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 3
\end{verbatim}

And we can parse a string for decimal values in much the same way.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{as.integer}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"5.27"}\NormalTok{)  }\CommentTok{\# coerce a decimal string }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 5
\end{verbatim}

On the other hand, it is erroneous trying to parse a non-decimal string.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{as.integer}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Joe"}\NormalTok{)   }\CommentTok{\# coerce an non{-}decimal string }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Warning: NAs introduced by coercion
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] NA
\end{verbatim}

We can convert booleans to numbers this way, too.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{as.integer}\NormalTok{(}\ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)    }\CommentTok{\# the numeric value of TRUE }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{as.integer}\NormalTok{(}\ConstantTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{)   }\CommentTok{\# the numeric value of FALSE }

\hypertarget{logical-boolean}{%

A logical value is often created via comparison between variables.

\begin{Shaded}

\NormalTok{x }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{1}
\NormalTok{y }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{2}   \CommentTok{\# sample values }

\NormalTok{z              }\CommentTok{\# print the logical value }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] FALSE
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "logical"
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{logical-operators-1}{%
\subsubsection{Logical Operators}\label{logical-operators-1}}

Standard logical operations are \texttt{\&} (and), \texttt{\textbar{}}
(or), and \texttt{!} (negation).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{u }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \ConstantTok{TRUE}
\NormalTok{v }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \ConstantTok{FALSE}
\NormalTok{u }\SpecialCharTok{\&}\NormalTok{ v          }\CommentTok{\# u AND v }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] FALSE
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{u }\SpecialCharTok{|}\NormalTok{ v          }\CommentTok{\# u OR v }
\end{Highlighting}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] TRUE
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialCharTok{!}\NormalTok{u             }\CommentTok{\# negation of u }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] FALSE
\end{verbatim}

Note that you can use \texttt{T} and \texttt{F} instead of \texttt{TRUE}
and \texttt{FALSE}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{a }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ T}
\NormalTok{b }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ F}
\NormalTok{a }\SpecialCharTok{\&}\NormalTok{ b}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] FALSE
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{characters}{%
\subsection{Characters}\label{characters}}

A character object is used to represent string values in R.

We convert objects into character values with the
\texttt{as.character()} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{as.character}\NormalTok{(}\FloatTok{3.14}\NormalTok{) }
\NormalTok{x}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "3.14"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(x)       }\CommentTok{\# print the class name of x }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "character"
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{paste}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{paste()}}{paste()}}\label{paste}}

Two character values can be concatenated with the \texttt{paste()}
function.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fname }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{"Joe"}
\NormalTok{lname }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\StringTok{"Smith"} 
\FunctionTok{paste}\NormalTok{(fname, lname) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "Joe Smith"
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{paste()} takes a \texttt{sep} argument:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{paste}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"A"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"B"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"C"}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{sep=}\StringTok{"{-}{-}"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "A--B--C"
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{sprintf}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{sprintf()}}{sprintf()}}\label{sprintf}}

However, it is often more convenient to create a readable string with
the \texttt{sprintf()} function, which has a C language syntax.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{sprintf}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"\%s has \%d dollars"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Sam"}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "Sam has 100 dollars"
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{substr}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{substr()}}{substr()}}\label{substr}}

To extract a substring, we apply the \texttt{substr()} function.

Here is an example showing how to extract the substring between the
third and twelfth positions in a string.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{substr}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Mary has a little lamb."}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{start=}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{stop=}\DecValTok{12}\NormalTok{) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "ry has a l"
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{sub}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{sub()}}{sub()}}\label{sub}}

And to replace the first occurrence of the word ``little'' by another
word ``big'' in the string, we apply the \texttt{sub()} function.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{sub}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"little"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"big"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Mary has a little lamb."}\NormalTok{) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "Mary has a big lamb."
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{r-data-structures}{%
\section{R Data Structures}\label{r-data-structures}}

Basic R comes with several data structures:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Vector
\item
  Matrix
\item
  Array
\item
  List
\item
  Data frame
\end{itemize}

A \textbf{vector} is what is called an array in many other programming
languages

\begin{quote}
A collection of cells with \textbf{a fixed size} where all cells hold
the \textbf{same data type} (integers or characters or reals or
whatever).
\end{quote}

A \textbf{matrix} is a two-dimensional vector (fixed size, all cell
types the same).

An \textbf{array} is a vector with one or more dimensions.

\begin{quote}
So, an array with one dimension is (almost) the same as a vector.\\
An array with two dimensions is (almost) the same as a matrix.\\
An array with three or more dimensions is an n-dimensional array.
\end{quote}

A \textbf{list} can hold items of different types and the list size can
be increased on the fly.

\begin{quote}
List contents can be accessed either by \textbf{index} (like
\texttt{mylist{[}{[}1{]}{]}}) or by \textbf{name} (like
\texttt{mylist\$age}).
\end{quote}

A \textbf{data frame} is called a \emph{table} in many languages.

\begin{quote}
Each column holds the same type, and the columns can have header
names.\\
A data frame is essential a kind of a list --- a list of vectors each
with the same length, but of varying data types.
\end{quote}

\textbf{The two most frequently uses are Vector and Data frame.}

So, we will look at vectors and data frames.

\begin{quote}
We will also look at lists since they are used internally to construct
data frames.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{vectors-and-c}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Vectors and
\texttt{c()}}{Vectors and c()}}\label{vectors-and-c}}

A vector is a sequence of data elements of the same basic type.

Members in a vector are officially called \emph{components}, but many
call them \emph{members}.

Vectors may be created with the \texttt{c()} function (``c'' stands for
combine).

Here is a vector of three numeric values 2, 3 and 5.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 2 3 5
\end{verbatim}

And here is a vector of logical values.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
\end{verbatim}

A vector can contain character strings.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"aa"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"bb"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"cc"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"dd"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"ee"}\NormalTok{) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "aa" "bb" "cc" "dd" "ee"
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{vectors-from-sequences-using-seq-and-rep}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Vectors from sequences using \texttt{:},
\texttt{seq()}, and
\texttt{rep()}}{Vectors from sequences using :, seq(), and rep()}}\label{vectors-from-sequences-using-seq-and-rep}}

Vectors can be made out of sequences which may be generated in a few
ways.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{s1 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{2}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{5}
\NormalTok{s1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 2 3 4 5
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{seq()} function is like Python's \texttt{range()}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{s2 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{seq}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{from=}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{to=}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{by=}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)  }\CommentTok{\# You can drop the argument names write seq(1,5,2)}
\NormalTok{s2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1 3 5
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{rep()} function will create a series of repeated values:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{s3 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{rep}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{s3}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1 1 1 1 1
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{length}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{length()}}{length()}}\label{length}}

The number of members in a vector is given by the \texttt{length()}
function.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{length}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"aa"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"bb"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"cc"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"dd"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"ee"}\NormalTok{)) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 5
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{combining-vectors-with-c}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Combining Vectors with
\texttt{c()}}{Combining Vectors with c()}}\label{combining-vectors-with-c}}

Vectors can be combined via the function \texttt{c()}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{n }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{) }
\NormalTok{s }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"aa"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"bb"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"cc"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"dd"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"ee"}\NormalTok{) }
 \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(n, s) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "2"  "3"  "5"  "aa" "bb" "cc" "dd" "ee"
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{value-coercion}{%
\subsubsection{Value Coercion}\label{value-coercion}}

Notice how \textbf{the numeric values are being coerced into character
strings} when the two vectors are combined.

This is necessary so as to maintain the same primitive data type for
members in the same vector.

\hypertarget{vector-math}{%
\subsubsection{Vector Math}\label{vector-math}}

Arithmetic operations of vectors are performed member-by-member, i.e.,
\textbf{member-wise}.

For example, suppose we have two vectors a and b.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{a }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{) }
\NormalTok{b }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{8}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Then, if we multiply a by 5, we would get a vector with each of its
members multiplied by 5.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{5} \SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{ a }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1]  5 15 25 35
\end{verbatim}

And if we add a and b together, the sum would be a vector whose members
are the sum of the corresponding members from a and b.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{a }\SpecialCharTok{+}\NormalTok{ b}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1]  2  5  9 15
\end{verbatim}

Similarly for subtraction, multiplication and division, we get new
vectors via member-wise operations.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{a }\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{ b }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1]  0  1  1 -1
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{a }\SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{ b }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{the-recycling-rule}{%
\subsubsection{The Recycling Rule}\label{the-recycling-rule}}

If two vectors are of unequal length, the \textbf{shorter one will be
recycled} in order to match the longer vector.

For example, the following vectors u and v have different lengths, and
their sum is computed by recycling values of the shorter vector u.

\begin{Shaded}

It really does mean subtraction!

For example, the following creates a vector slice with the third member
removed.

\hypertarget{logical-index-vectors}{%
\subsubsection{Logical Index Vectors}\label{logical-index-vectors}}

A new vector can be sliced from a given vector with a logical index
vector.

The logical vector must the same length as the original vector.

Its members are TRUE if the corresponding members in the original vector
are to be included in the slice, and FALSE if otherwise.

\begin{quote}
This is what we called \textbf{boolean filtering} and masking in Python.
\end{quote}

For example, consider the following vector s of length 5.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To retrieve the the second and fourth members of s, we define a logical
vector L of the same length, and have its second and fourth members set
as TRUE.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{L }\OtherTok{=} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\ConstantTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{)}

Note that odd bracket notation.

Each list member \textbf{contains} a vector.

\hypertarget{list-slicing}{%
\subsubsection{List Slicing}\label{list-slicing}}

We retrieve a list slice with the single square bracket \texttt{{[}{]}}
operator.

The following is a slice containing the second member of \texttt{x},

\hypertarget{member-reference-with}{%

To reference a list member directly, we use the double square bracket
\texttt{{[}{[}{]}{]}} operator.

The following object \texttt{x{[}{[}2{]}{]}} is the second member of
\texttt{x}.

In other words, \textbf{\texttt{x{[}{[}2{]}{]}} is a copy of \texttt{s},
but is not a slice containing \texttt{s} or its copy}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x[}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{]}

\hypertarget{data-frames}{%
\subsection{Data Frames}\label{data-frames}}

A data frame is used for storing data tables.

It is essentially \textbf{a list of vectors of equal length}. For
example, the following variable df is a data frame containing three
vectors \texttt{n}, \texttt{s}, \texttt{b}.

You can think of a data frame is a special kind of list.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  n  s     b
1 2 aa  TRUE
2 3 bb FALSE
3 5 cc  TRUE
\end{verbatim}

Notice that data frames are built \textbf{column-wise} -- this is true
of Pandas data frames as well.

The top line of the data frame is the \textbf{header}; it contains the
column names.

The data type is list below the column name.

Each horizontal line afterward denotes a data row, which begins with the
name of the row, and then followed by the actual data.

Each data member of a row is called a cell.

\end{verbatim}

We can also retrieve with the ``\$'' operator in lieu of the double
square bracket operator

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mtcars}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{am }
\end{Highlighting}

\end{verbatim}

Yet another way to retrieve the same column vector is to use the single
square bracket ``{[}{]}'' operator. We prepend the column name with a
comma character, which signals a wildcard match for the row position

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mtcars[, }\StringTok{"am"}\NormalTok{] }
\end{Highlighting}

\hypertarget{data-frame-column-slice}{%
\subsubsection{Data Frame Column Slice}\label{data-frame-column-slice}}

We retrieve a data frame column \textbf{slice} with the single square

Note: This is like a one-column dataframe in Pandas, as opposed to a
Series.

This is similar to the \texttt{.values()} method in Pandas, which

\hypertarget{data-frame-row-slice}{%
\subsubsection{Data Frame Row Slice}\label{data-frame-row-slice}}

We retrieve rows from a data frame with the single square bracket
operator, just like what we did with columns. However, in additional to
an index vector of row positions, we append an extra comma character.
This is important, as the extra comma signals a wildcard match for the
second coordinate for column positions.

\hypertarget{numeric-indexing-1}{%
\paragraph{Numeric Indexing}\label{numeric-indexing-1}}

For example, the following retrieves a row record of the built-in data
set mtcars. Please notice the extra comma in the square bracket
operator, and it is not a typo. It states that the 1974 Camaro Z28 has a
gas mileage of 13.3 miles per gallon, and an eight cylinder 245 horse

\hypertarget{importing-data}{%
\subsubsection{Importing Data}\label{importing-data}}

It is often necessary to import sample textbook data into R before you
start working on your homework.

\textbf{Excel Files}

Quite frequently, the sample data is in Excel format, and needs to be
imported into R prior to use. For this, we can use the function read.xls
from the gdata package. It reads from an Excel spreadsheet and returns a
data frame. The following shows how to load an Excel spreadsheet named
``mydata.xls''. This method requires Perl runtime to be present in the
system

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DocumentationTok{\#\#library(gdata)                   \# load gdata package }
\DocumentationTok{\#\#help(read.xls)                   \# documentation }
\DocumentationTok{\#\#mydata \textless{}{-} read.xls("mydata.xls")  \# read from first sheet}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Alternatively, we can use the function loadWorkbook from the XLConnect
package to read the entire workbook, and then load the worksheets with
readWorksheet. The XLConnect package requires Java to be pre-installed

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DocumentationTok{\#\#library(XLConnect)               \# load XLConnect package }
\DocumentationTok{\#\#wk \textless{}{-} loadWorkbook("mydata.xls") }
\DocumentationTok{\#\#df \textless{}{-} readWorksheet(wk, sheet="Sheet1")}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{Table Files}

A data table can resides in a text file.

The cells inside the table are separated by blank characters.

Here is an example of a table with 4 rows and 3 columns.

\begin{verbatim}
100 a1 b1 
200 a2 b2 
300 a3 b3 
400 a4 b4
\end{verbatim}

Now copy and paste the table above in a file named ``mydata.txt'' with a
text editor.

Then load the data into the workspace with the function read.table

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mydata }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read.table}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"mydata.txt"}\NormalTok{)  }\CommentTok{\# read text file }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Warning in read.table("mydata.txt"): incomplete final line found by
readTableHeader on 'mydata.txt'
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mydata                             }\CommentTok{\# print data frame }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
   V1 V2 V3
1 100 a1 b1
2 200 a2 b2
3 300 a3 b3
4 400 a4 b4
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{CSV Files}

The sample data can also be in comma separated values (CSV) format. Each
cell inside such data file is separated by a special character, which
usually is a comma, although other characters can be used as well.

The first row of the data file should contain the column names instead
of the actual data. Here is a sample of the expected format.

\begin{verbatim}
Col1,Col2,Col3 
100,a1,b1 
200,a2,b2 
300,a3,b3
\end{verbatim}

After we copy and paste the data above in a file named ``mydata.csv''
with a text editor, we can read the data with the function read.csv

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mydata }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read.csv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"mydata.csv"}\NormalTok{)  }\CommentTok{\# read csv file }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Warning in read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote, :
incomplete final line found by readTableHeader on 'mydata.csv'
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mydata }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  Col1 Col2 Col3
1  100   a1  b1 
2  200   a2  b2 
3  300   a3   b3
\end{verbatim}

In various European locales, as the comma character serves as the
decimal point, the function read.csv2 should be used instead. For
further detail of the read.csv and read.csv2 functions, please consult
the R documentation

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{help}\NormalTok{(read.csv)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{working-directory}{%
\subsubsection{Working Directory}\label{working-directory}}

Finally, the code samples above assume the data files are located in the
R working directory, which can be found with the function
\texttt{getwd()}.

Note that these things can also be set using the RStudio's GUI.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{getwd}\NormalTok{()               }\CommentTok{\# get current working directory}

[1] "/Users/rca2t1/Dropbox/Courses/DS/DS5100/DS5100-2023-07-R/repo/notebooks/M10_RBasics"
\end{verbatim}

You can select a different working directory with the function setwd(),
and thus avoid entering the full path of the data files

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DocumentationTok{\#\# setwd("\textless{}new path\textgreater{}")   \# set working directory}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that the forward slash should be used as the path separator even on
Windows platform

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DocumentationTok{\#\# setwd("C:/MyDoc")}

\hypertarget{value-counts-with-table}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Value Counts with
\texttt{table()}}{Value Counts with table()}}\label{value-counts-with-table}}

This function is like \texttt{.value\_counts()} in Pandas. It does a
quick count of all the value types of a feature or combination of them.

Here we get a table of values and their counts for
\texttt{airquality\$Temp}, convert this into a data frame, and then plot
the results.

You've seen this in Python.

They work the same way in both languages.

Here's their syntax in R.

\begin{verbatim}
if(<condition>) {
        ## do something
} 

if(<condition>) {
        ## do something
} 
else {
        ## do something else

\hypertarget{for-loops}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{for}
Loops}{for Loops}}\label{for-loops}}

For loops are straight-forward. The take an interator variable, e.g.
\texttt{i}, and assign it successive values from a sequence or vector.

For loops are often used to iteratE over the elements of an object
(list, vector, etc.).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{(i }\ControlFlowTok{in} \DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{) \{}
  \FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(i)}

\end{verbatim}

According to Hadley Wickham, loops are pretty much the only looping
construct that you will need in R.

The following three loops all have the same behavior.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"a"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"b"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"c"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"d"}\NormalTok{)}

  \CommentTok{\# Print out each element of \textquotesingle{}x\textquotesingle{}}
  \FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(x[i])  }
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

[1] "c"
[1] "d"
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{seq_along}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{seq\_along()}}{seq\_along()}}\label{seq_along}}

The \texttt{seq\_along()} function is commonly used in conjunction with
for loops in order to generate an integer sequence based on the length
of an object (in this case, the object x).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "a" "b" "c" "d"
\end{verbatim}

Generate a sequence based on length of `x':

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

  \FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(x[i])}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "a"
[1] "b"
[1] "c"
[1] "d"
\end{verbatim}

It is not necessary to use an index-type variable.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{(letter }\ControlFlowTok{in}\NormalTok{ x) \{}
  \FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(letter)}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "a"
[1] "b"
[1] "c"
[1] "d"
\end{verbatim}

For one line loops, the curly braces are not strictly necessary.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{(i }\ControlFlowTok{in} \DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{) }\FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(x[i])}

\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{nested-for-loops}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Nested \texttt{for}

Dor loops can be nested inside of each other.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1
[1] 3
[1] 5
[1] 2

\end{verbatim}

Nested loops are used to generate multidimensional or hierarchical data
structures (e.g.~matrices, lists).

\hypertarget{while-loops}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{while}
Loops}{while Loops}}\label{while-loops}}

As with Python, while loops start with a condition. It loops while the
condition is true and stops when it is false.

Remembe, while loops can go on forever is the truth condition is never
met.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{repeat-loops}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{repeat}
Loops}{repeat Loops}}\label{repeat-loops}}

\texttt{repeat} loops are using by R. They initiate an infinite loop
right from the start.

The only way to exit a repeat loop is to call break on an internal
condition.

\hypertarget{next-and-break}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{next} and
\texttt{break}}{next and break}}\label{next-and-break}}

next is used to skip an iteration of a loop. Same as Python
\texttt{continue}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ (i }\ControlFlowTok{in} \DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{) \{}

\NormalTok{  \}      }\CommentTok{\# Do something here}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\texttt{break} is used to exit a loop immediately.

If \texttt{z} isn't defined in the function, how does this work?

R's scoping rules are similar to Python's.

Since \texttt{z} isn't in the function, \textbf{R looks in the
function's environment} for it.

For more on scoping rules, see

15: Scoping Rules of R} in Peng's \emph{R Programming For Data Science}.

Narrow columns are more manageable by databases.

Wide columns are more usable for analysis.

You can do these things with narrow tables using \texttt{.group\_by()}

\hypertarget{the-tidyverse}{%
\section{The Tidyverse}\label{the-tidyverse}}

Tidyverse is a collection of essential R packages for data science.

The packages included in the Tidyverse are designed to support the
pipeline of activities associated with data science, such as filtering,
transforming, visualizing, etc.

\includegraphics{notebooks/M11_RDplyr/images/paste-EE0D9577.png}

Tidyverse was created by \textbf{Hadley Wickham} and his team with the
aim of providing all these utilities to clean and work with data.

Here's a graphic of the packages associated with the TV:

\includegraphics{notebooks/M11_RDplyr/images/paste-32BD3A67.png}

We are going to focus on \texttt{dplyr} today and \texttt{ggplot}
tomorrow.

\hypertarget{dplyr}{%
\section{Dplyr}\label{dplyr}}

Dplyr introduces \textbf{new set of functions} that make working with
data more intuitive.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It does this by introducing a set of functions that work together well
  to produce pipelines of actions.
\end{itemize}

But as important, it introduces a \textbf{vocabulary} for talking about
data.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This makes it possible to imagine solutions verbally, and then to
  implement them in code.
\end{itemize}

To use the TV, we usually import everything:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(tidyverse)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
-- Attaching packages --------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.3.2 --
v ggplot2 3.3.5     v purrr   1.0.1
v tibble  3.2.1     v dplyr   1.1.1
v tidyr   1.2.1     v stringr 1.5.0
v readr   2.1.3     v forcats 1.0.0
-- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() --
x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{piping-with}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Piping with
\texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%}}{Piping with \%\textgreater\%}}\label{piping-with}}

Just a quick note about this \textbf{odd looking} operator that you will
start to see.

One of the key elements of the TV is the use of \textbf{piping}, or the
ability of to pass the return values of one function to another, with
without have to nest functions.

For example, instead of something like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{a }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{"Hello"}
\NormalTok{b }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{"World"}

\NormalTok{var1 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(a, b)}
\NormalTok{var2 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{paste}\NormalTok{(var1)}
\FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(var2)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "Hello" "World"
\end{verbatim}

Or this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{paste}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(a,b)))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "Hello" "World"
\end{verbatim}

We can do:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(a, b) }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
  \FunctionTok{paste}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
  \FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "Hello" "World"
\end{verbatim}

Although the last pattern is longer than the preceding, it is much
easier to read and write, especially when we are working with several
connected functions.

This is similar to \textbf{method chaining} in Python, but is more
pervasive.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In Python you can do it with individual objects that return themselves
  (as it were).
\item
  In TV, you can apply it to \textbf{any two methods} so long as it
  makes sense to pass the output of as the input of another.
\item
  Basically, the output of one function becomes the first argument of
  the following the \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%}.
\end{itemize}

It is similar to the pipe operator \texttt{\textbar{}} in Unix shells.

\hypertarget{tibbles}{%
\chapter{Tibbles}\label{tibbles}}

Dplyr can work with different rectangular data structures:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Data frames
\item
  Tibbles
\item
  Data.tables (see
  \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html}{data.table})
\end{itemize}

The foundational data structure of the TV is the \textbf{tibble}.

Tibbles are data frames, but they tweak some older behaviors to make
your life a little easier.

To learn more about tibbles, check out the vignette:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{creating-tibbles}{%
\section{Creating tibbles}\label{creating-tibbles}}

If you need to make a tibble ``by hand'', you can use \texttt{tibble()}
or \texttt{tribble()}.

\texttt{tibble()} works by assembling individual vectors,
\textbf{column-wise} operation:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{y }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"a"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"b"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"h"}\NormalTok{)}
\FunctionTok{tibble}\NormalTok{(x, y)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 3 x 2
      x y    
  <dbl> <chr>
1     1 a    
2     2 b    
3     5 h    
\end{verbatim}

You can also optionally name the inputs, provide data inline with
\texttt{c()}, and perform computation:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{tibble}\NormalTok{(}
  \AttributeTok{x1 =}\NormalTok{ x,}
  \AttributeTok{x2 =} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{15}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{25}\NormalTok{),}
  \AttributeTok{y =} \FunctionTok{sqrt}\NormalTok{(x1}\SpecialCharTok{\^{}}\DecValTok{2} \SpecialCharTok{+}\NormalTok{ x2}\SpecialCharTok{\^{}}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 3 x 3
     x1    x2     y
  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
1     1    10  10.0
2     2    15  15.1
3     5    25  25.5
\end{verbatim}

Every column in a data frame or tibble must be same length, so you'll
get an error if the lengths are different:

As the error suggests, individual values will be recycled to the same
length as everything else:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{tibble}\NormalTok{(}
  \AttributeTok{x =} \DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{,}
  \AttributeTok{y =} \StringTok{"a"}\NormalTok{,}
  \AttributeTok{z =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}
\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 5 x 3
      x y     z    
  <int> <chr> <lgl>
1     1 a     TRUE 
2     2 a     TRUE 
3     3 a     TRUE 
4     4 a     TRUE 
5     5 a     TRUE 
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{tribbles}{%
\section{Tribbles}\label{tribbles}}

Another way to create a tibble is with \texttt{tribble()}, which short
for \textbf{transposed tibble}.

\texttt{tribble()} is customized for data entry in code: \textbf{column
headings start with \texttt{\textasciitilde{}}} and \textbf{entries are
separated by commas}.

This makes it possible to lay out small amounts of data in an easy to
read form:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{tribble}\NormalTok{(}
  \SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{x, }\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{y, }\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{z,}
  \StringTok{"a"}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{3.6}\NormalTok{,}
  \StringTok{"b"}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{8.5}
\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 2 x 3
  x         y     z
  <chr> <dbl> <dbl>
1 a         2   3.6
2 b         1   8.5
\end{verbatim}

Finally, if you have a regular \texttt{data\ frame} you can turn it into
to a tibble with \texttt{as\_tibble()}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{as\_tibble}\NormalTok{(mtcars)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 32 x 11
     mpg   cyl  disp    hp  drat    wt  qsec    vs    am  gear  carb
   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
 1  21       6  160    110  3.9   2.62  16.5     0     1     4     4
 2  21       6  160    110  3.9   2.88  17.0     0     1     4     4
 3  22.8     4  108     93  3.85  2.32  18.6     1     1     4     1
 4  21.4     6  258    110  3.08  3.22  19.4     1     0     3     1
 5  18.7     8  360    175  3.15  3.44  17.0     0     0     3     2
 6  18.1     6  225    105  2.76  3.46  20.2     1     0     3     1
 7  14.3     8  360    245  3.21  3.57  15.8     0     0     3     4
 8  24.4     4  147.    62  3.69  3.19  20       1     0     4     2
 9  22.8     4  141.    95  3.92  3.15  22.9     1     0     4     2
10  19.2     6  168.   123  3.92  3.44  18.3     1     0     4     4
# i 22 more rows
\end{verbatim}

The inverse of \texttt{as\_tibble()} is \texttt{as.data.frame()}; it
converts a tibble back into a regular \texttt{data.frame}.

\hypertarget{non-syntactic-names}{%
\section{Non-syntactic names}\label{non-syntactic-names}}

It's possible for a tibble to have column names that are not valid R
variable names, names that are \textbf{non-syntactic}.

For example, the variables might not start with a letter or they might
contain unusual characters like a space.

To refer to these variables, you need to surround them with backticks,
\texttt{\textasciigrave{}}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{tb }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{tibble}\NormalTok{(}
  \StringTok{\textasciigrave{}}\AttributeTok{:)}\StringTok{\textasciigrave{}} \OtherTok{=} \StringTok{"smile"}\NormalTok{, }
  \StringTok{\textasciigrave{}}\AttributeTok{ }\StringTok{\textasciigrave{}} \OtherTok{=} \StringTok{"space"}\NormalTok{,}
  \StringTok{\textasciigrave{}}\AttributeTok{2000}\StringTok{\textasciigrave{}} \OtherTok{=} \StringTok{"number"}
\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{tb}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 3
  `:)`  ` `   `2000`
  <chr> <chr> <chr> 
1 smile space number
\end{verbatim}

You'll also need the backticks when working with these variables in
other packages, like ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr.

\hypertarget{tibbles-vs.-data.frame}{%
\chapter{Tibbles vs.~data.frame}\label{tibbles-vs.-data.frame}}

There are two main differences in the usage of a tibble vs.~a classic
\texttt{dat\ frame}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{printing} and \textbf{subsetting}.
\end{itemize}

If these difference cause problems when working with older packages, you
can turn a tibble back to a regular data frame with
\texttt{as.data.frame()}.

\hypertarget{printing}{%
\section{Printing}\label{printing}}

The print method:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Only the first 10 rows
\item
  All the columns that fit on screen.
\end{itemize}

This makes it much easier to work with large data.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

Where possible, \textbf{tibbles also use color} to draw your eye to
important differences.

One of the most important distinctions is between the string
\texttt{"NA"} and the missing value, \texttt{NA}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{tibble}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"NA"}\NormalTok{, }\ConstantTok{NA}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 2 x 1
  x    
  <chr>
1 NA   
2 <NA> 
\end{verbatim}

Tibbles are designed to avoid overwhelming your console when you print
large data frames.

But \textbf{sometimes you need more output} than the default display.

There are a few options that can help.

First, you can explicitly \texttt{print()} the data frame and control
the number of rows (\texttt{n}) and the \texttt{width} of the display.
\texttt{width\ =\ Inf} will display all columns:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(nycflights13)}
\NormalTok{flights }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
  \FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{n =} \DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{width =} \ConstantTok{Inf}\NormalTok{)}

You can also \textbf{control the default print behavior} by setting
options:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{options(tibble.print\_max\ =\ n,\ tibble.print\_min\ =\ m)}:
  if more than \texttt{n} rows, print only \texttt{m} rows.
\item
  Use \texttt{options(tibble.print\_min\ =\ Inf)} to always show all
  rows.
\item
  Use \texttt{options(tibble.width\ =\ Inf)} to always print all
  columns, regardless of the width of the screen.
\end{itemize}

You can see a complete list of options by looking at the package help
with \texttt{package?tibble}.

\hypertarget{using-view}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Using
\texttt{View()}}{Using View()}}\label{using-view}}

A final option is to use RStudio's built-in data viewer to get a
scrollable view of the complete dataset. This is also often useful at
the end of a long chain of manipulations.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{flights }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{extracting-variables}{%
\section{Extracting variables}\label{extracting-variables}}

So far all the tools you've learned have worked with complete data
frames.

If you want to pull out a single variable, you can use
\texttt{dplyr::pull()}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{tb }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{tibble}\NormalTok{(}
  \AttributeTok{id =}\NormalTok{ LETTERS[}\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{],}
  \AttributeTok{x1  =} \DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{,}
  \AttributeTok{y1  =} \DecValTok{6}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{10}
\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{tb }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}  
  \FunctionTok{pull}\NormalTok{(x1) }\CommentTok{\# by name}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{tb }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}  
  \FunctionTok{pull}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)  }\CommentTok{\# by position}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "A" "B" "C" "D" "E"
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{pull()} also takes an optional \texttt{name} argument that
specifies the column to be used as names for a named vector, which
you'll learn about in \textbf{?@sec-vectors}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{tb }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}  
  \FunctionTok{pull}\NormalTok{(x1, }\AttributeTok{name =}\NormalTok{ id)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
A B C D E 
1 2 3 4 5 
\end{verbatim}

You can also use the base R tools \texttt{\$} and \texttt{{[}{[}}.
\texttt{{[}{[}} can extract by name or position; \texttt{\$} only
extracts by name but is a little less typing.

Extract by name:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{tb}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{x1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{tb[[}\StringTok{"x1"}\NormalTok{]]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
\end{verbatim}

Extract by position:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{tb[[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{]]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "A" "B" "C" "D" "E"
\end{verbatim}

Compared to a \texttt{data\ frame}, \textbf{tibbles are more strict}:
they never do partial matching, and they will generate a warning if the
column you are trying to access does not exist.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Tibbles complain a lot:}
\NormalTok{tb}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{x}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Warning: Unknown or uninitialised column: `x`.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
NULL
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{tb}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{z}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Warning: Unknown or uninitialised column: `z`.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
NULL
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Data frame use partial matching and don\textquotesingle{}t complain if a column doesn\textquotesingle{}t exist}
\NormalTok{df }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{as.data.frame}\NormalTok{(tb)}
\NormalTok{df}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{x}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{df}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{z}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
NULL
\end{verbatim}

For this reason we sometimes joke that \textbf{tibbles are lazy and
surly}: they do less and complain more.

\hypertarget{subsetting}{%
\section{Subsetting}\label{subsetting}}

Lastly, there are some important differences when using \texttt{{[}}.

With \texttt{data.frame}s, \texttt{{[}} sometimes returns a
\texttt{data.frame}, and sometimes returns a vector.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This is a common source of bugs.
\end{itemize}

With tibbles, \textbf{\texttt{{[}} always returns another tibble}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  This can sometimes cause problems when working with older code.
\item
  If you hit one of those functions, just use \texttt{as.data.frame()}
  to turn your tibble back to a \texttt{data.frame}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{nb-the-dplyr-package}{%
\chapter{\texorpdfstring{NB: The \texttt{dplyr}
package}{NB: The dplyr package}}\label{nb-the-dplyr-package}}

\begin{quote}
Based on \href{https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/}{Peng 2022}
\end{quote}

The \texttt{dplyr} package was developed by Hadley Wickham of RStudio
and is an optimized and distilled version of his \texttt{plyr} package.

\begin{quote}
\texttt{plyr} is an attempt to organize much of the functionality of the
\texttt{*apply} family of methods in R. Some of these methods are
superseded by dplyr and plyr, but
\href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3505701/grouping-functions-tapply-by-aggregate-and-the-apply-family}{they
remain useful}.
\end{quote}

The \texttt{dplyr} package does not provide any ``new'' functionality to
R per se, in the sense that everything \texttt{dplyr} does could already
be done with base R, but it \emph{greatly} simplifies existing
functionality in R.

One important contribution of the \texttt{dplyr} package is that it
provides a ``grammar'' (in particular, verbs) for data manipulation and
for operating on data frames. With this grammar, you can sensibly
communicate what it is that you are doing to a data frame that other
people can understand (assuming they also know the grammar). This is
useful because it provides an abstraction for data manipulation that
previously did not exist. Another useful contribution is that the
\texttt{dplyr} functions are \textbf{very} fast, as many key operations
are coded in C++.

\hypertarget{dplyr-grammar}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{dplyr}
Grammar}{dplyr Grammar}}\label{dplyr-grammar}}

Some of the key ``verbs'' provided by the \texttt{dplyr} package are

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{select}: return a subset of the columns of a data frame, using
  a flexible notation
\item
  \texttt{filter}: extract a subset of rows from a data frame based on
  logical conditions
\item
  \texttt{arrange}: reorder rows of a data frame
\item
  \texttt{rename}: rename variables in a data frame
\item
  \texttt{mutate}: add new variables/columns or transform existing
  variables
\item
  \texttt{summarise} / \texttt{summarize}: generate summary statistics
  of different variables in the data frame, possibly within strata
\item
  \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%}: the ``pipe'' operator is used to connect
  multiple verb actions together into a pipeline
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{dplyr} package as a number of its own data types that it
takes advantage of. For example, there is a handy \texttt{print} method
that prevents you from printing a lot of data to the console. Most of
the time, these additional data types are transparent to the user and do
not need to be worried about.

\hypertarget{common-dplyr-function-properties}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Common \texttt{dplyr} Function
Properties}{Common dplyr Function Properties}}\label{common-dplyr-function-properties}}

All of the functions that we will discuss in this Chapter will have a
few common characteristics. In particular,

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The first argument is a data frame.
\item
  The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame
  specified in the first argument, and you can refer to columns in the
  data frame directly without using the \$ operator (just use the column
  names).
\item
  The return result of a function is a new data frame.
\item
  Data frames must be properly formatted and annotated for this to all
  be useful. In particular, the data must be
  \href{http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper}{tidy}. In short, there
  should be one observation per row, and each column should represent a
  feature or characteristic of that observation.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{installing-the-dplyr-package}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Installing the \texttt{dplyr}
package}{Installing the dplyr package}}\label{installing-the-dplyr-package}}

The \texttt{dplyr} package can be installed from CRAN or from GitHub
using the \texttt{devtools} package and the \texttt{install\_github()}
function. The GitHub repository will usually contain the latest updates
to the package and the development version.

To install from CRAN, just run

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"dplyr"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To install from GitHub you can run

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{install\_github}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"hadley/dplyr"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

After installing the package it is important that you load it into your
R session with the \texttt{library()} function.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(dplyr)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

Attaching package: 'dplyr'
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':

    filter, lag
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
The following objects are masked from 'package:base':

    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
\end{verbatim}

You may get some warnings when the package is loaded because there are
functions in the \texttt{dplyr} package that have the same name as
functions in other packages. For now you can ignore the warnings.

\hypertarget{getting-a-dataset}{%
\section{Getting a dataset}\label{getting-a-dataset}}

Let's use a dataset containing air pollution and temperature data for
the
\href{http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/leanpub/rprog/chicago_data.zip}{city
of Chicago} in the U.S.

\begin{quote}
You will find the data in the directory for this module.

Load the data into R using the \texttt{readRDS()} function.

\hypertarget{select}{%
\chapter{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{select()}}{select()}}\label{select}}

We use the \texttt{select()} function to \textbf{select columns you want
to focus on}.

Suppose we wanted to take the first 3 columns only.

There are a few ways to do this.

We could for example use numerical indices.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{names}\NormalTok{(chicago)[}\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "city" "tmpd" "dptp"
\end{verbatim}

But we can also use the names directly.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{chicago }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
  \FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(city}\SpecialCharTok{:}\NormalTok{dptp)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
     city  tmpd      dptp

\end{verbatim}

Note the use of \texttt{:} inside the \texttt{select()} --- you can use
it to specify a range of variable names.

You can also \emph{omit} variables using the \texttt{select()} function
by using \textbf{the negative sign}. With \texttt{select()} you can do

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(chicago, }\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{(city}\SpecialCharTok{:}\NormalTok{dptp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This indicates that we should include every variable \emph{except} the
variables \texttt{city} through \texttt{dptp}.

The equivalent code in base R would be

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{i }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{match}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"city"}\NormalTok{, }\FunctionTok{names}\NormalTok{(chicago))}
\NormalTok{j }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{match}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"dptp"}\NormalTok{, }\FunctionTok{names}\NormalTok{(chicago))}
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(chicago[, }\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{(i}\SpecialCharTok{:}\NormalTok{j)])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Not super intuitive, right?

The \texttt{select()} function also allows a special syntax that allows
you to specify \textbf{variable names based on patterns}.

So, for example, if you wanted to keep every variable that ends with a
``2'', we could do

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{chicago }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
  \FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{ends\_with}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"2"}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This is super useful if you have a table with prefixes, such as
\texttt{doc\_}.

You can also use more general \textbf{regular expressions} if necessary.

See \texttt{?select} for more info.

\hypertarget{filter}{%
\chapter{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{filter()}}{filter()}}\label{filter}}

The \texttt{filter()} function extracts \textbf{subsets of rows} from a
data frame.

\begin{quote}
\texttt{select()} is a \textbf{column-wise} operation, \texttt{filter()}
is \textbf{row-wise}.
\end{quote}

This function is similar to the existing \texttt{subset()} function in R
but is quite a bit faster.

Suppose we wanted to extract the rows of the \texttt{chicago} data frame
where \textbf{the levels of PM2.5 are greater than 30} (which is a
reasonably high level), we could do

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{chicago }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(pm25tmean2 }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}} \DecValTok{30}\NormalTok{)}

Use \texttt{arrange()} to \textbf{reorder rows} of a data frame
according to one or more of the \textbf{columns}.

\begin{quote}
This normally called \textbf{sorting}, but this word is already used in
R.
\end{quote}

Reordering rows of a data frame (while preserving corresponding order of
other columns) is normally a pain to do in R.

The \texttt{arrange()} function simplifies the process quite a bit.

Here we order the rows of the data frame by date in ascending order:

\hypertarget{rename}{%

Renaming a variable in a data frame in R is surprisingly hard to do!

The \texttt{rename()} function is designed to make this process easier.

Here we the names of the first five variables in the \texttt{chicago}
data frame.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(chicago[, }\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{], }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{)}

\begin{verbatim}

3 chic 33.0 27.375 1987-01-03         NA
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{dptp} column is supposed to represent the dew point
temperature and the \texttt{pm25tmean2} column provides the PM2.5 data.

However, these names are awkward and should be renamed to something more
sensible.

\end{verbatim}

The syntax inside the \texttt{rename()} function is to have the new name
on the left-hand side of the \texttt{=} sign and the old name on the
right-hand side.

I leave it as an exercise for the reader to figure how you do this in
base R without \texttt{dplyr}.

\hypertarget{mutate}{%
\chapter{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{mutate()}}{mutate()}}\label{mutate}}

The \texttt{mutate()} function creates new columns based on computations
usually involving the other columns.

For example, with air pollution data, \textbf{we often want to
\emph{detrend} the data by subtracting the mean from the data}.

That way we can look at whether a given day's air pollution level is
higher than or less than average (as opposed to looking at its absolute
level).

Here we create a \texttt{pm25detrend} variable that subtracts the mean
from the \texttt{pm25} variable.

\NormalTok{chicago }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ chicago }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}

There is also the related \texttt{transmute()} function, which does the
same thing as \texttt{mutate()} but then \textbf{\emph{drops all
non-transformed variables}}.

Here we detrend the PM10 and ozone (O3) variables.

Note that there are only two columns in the transmuted data frame.

\hypertarget{group_by}{%
\chapter{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{group\_by()}}{group\_by()}}\label{group_by}}

The \texttt{group\_by()} function is used to generate \textbf{summary or
aggregate statistics} from a data frame.

For example, in this air pollution dataset, you might want to know the
\textbf{average annual level of PM2.5}.

So \textbf{the stratum is the year}, which we can derive from the
\texttt{date} variable.

\textbf{In conjunction with the \texttt{group\_by()} function we often
use the \texttt{summarize()} function.} \textgreater{} Or
\texttt{summarise()} for some parts of the world.

The general operation here is a combination of \textbf{splitting} a
tabel into separate pieces defined by a variable or group of variables
(\texttt{group\_by()}), and then \textbf{applying} a summary function
across those subsets (\texttt{summarize()}), then \textbf{combining}
back into another table.

\begin{quote}
This pattern is called \textbf{split, apply, and combine}. It is a
fundamental pattern in data processing.
\end{quote}

First, we can create a \texttt{year} variable using
\texttt{as.POSIXlt()}.

Now we can create a that computes summary statistics for each year in
the data frame with the \texttt{summarize()} function.

6  1992   NaN  50.8  24.8
\end{verbatim}

Note in the process, we implicitly created separate data frame that
splits the original data frame by year, which is then passed to
\texttt{summarize()}.

\texttt{summarize()} then returns a data frame with columns for
\texttt{year} and the annual averages of \texttt{pm25}, \texttt{o3}, and
\texttt{no2}.

In a slightly more complicated example, we might want to know what are
the average levels of ozone (\texttt{o3}) and nitrogen dioxide
(\texttt{no2}) within quintiles of \texttt{pm25}.

A slicker way to do this would be through a regression model, but we can
actually do this quickly with \texttt{group\_by()} and
\texttt{summarize()}.

First, we can create a categorical variable of \texttt{pm25} divided
into quantiles.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{qq }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{quantile}\NormalTok{(chicago}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{pm25, }\FunctionTok{seq}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{0.2}\NormalTok{), }\AttributeTok{na.rm =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Then can group the data frame by the \texttt{pm25.quint} variable. and
compute the mean of \texttt{o3} and \texttt{no2} within quantiles of
\texttt{pm25}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{chicago }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
  \FunctionTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{pm25.quint =} \FunctionTok{cut}\NormalTok{(pm25, qq)) }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
  \FunctionTok{group\_by}\NormalTok{(pm25.quint) }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
  \FunctionTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{o3 =} \FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(o3tmean2, }\AttributeTok{na.rm =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{), }
          \AttributeTok{no2 =} \FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(no2tmean2, }\AttributeTok{na.rm =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{),}
          \AttributeTok{.groups =} \StringTok{"drop"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 6 x 3

5 (22.6,61.5]  20.3  29.6
6 <NA>         18.8  25.8
\end{verbatim}

From the table, it seems there isn't a strong relationship between
\texttt{pm25} and \texttt{o3}, but there appears to be a positive
correlation between \texttt{pm25} and \texttt{no2}.

More sophisticated statistical modeling can help to provide precise
answers to these questions, but a simple application of \texttt{dplyr}
functions can often get you most of the way there.

\chapter{Summary}\label{summary-2}}

The \texttt{dplyr} package provides a concise set of operations for
managing data frames and tibbles.

It allows us to perform a number of complex operations in just a few
lines of code.

In particular, we can often conduct the beginnings of an exploratory
analysis with the powerful combination of \texttt{group\_by()} and
\texttt{summarize()}.

Once you learn the \texttt{dplyr} grammar there are a few additional
benefits - \texttt{dplyr} can work with other data frame ``back ends''
such as SQL databases. There is an SQL interface for relational
databases via the DBI package - \texttt{dplyr} can be integrated with
the \texttt{data.table} package for large fast tables

The \texttt{dplyr} package is handy way to both simplify and speed up
your data frame management code. It's rare that you get such a
combination at the same time!

Today we'll look at GGPlot2, the graphics package associated with the
\textbf{Tidyverse}.

\hypertarget{learning-goal}{%
\section{Learning Goal}\label{learning-goal}}

You will be introduced into how and why to use \textbf{visualizations}
in DS 6001.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Visualizations in EDA
\item
  Visualization in creating data products that communicate results, such
  as scientific publications, infographics, and interactive
  visualizations.
\end{itemize}

These things come at the end of the data science \textbf{pipeline}.

Today, I just want to introduce you to the thinking and \textbf{design
logic} behind the package, so you can be confident in learning more as
you need to.

\hypertarget{the-grammar-of-graphics}{%
\section{The Grammar of Graphics}\label{the-grammar-of-graphics}}

As with Dplyr, GGPlot2 is a an entirely new system that
\textbf{supplants} the older graph functions that are built into R.

And just as with Dplyr, it is founded on a principled analysis of its
domain and approaches code design through developing a basic
\textbf{grammar} which can then be expressed in R.

In effect, Dplyr is built on a \textbf{grammar of data} by defining a
set of \textbf{verbs} that can be used to build phrases that are put
together into larger constructs.

These verbs correspond to a \textbf{process} of data transformation.

GGPlot2 is built on a \textbf{grammar of graphics} that defines a set of
\textbf{nouns} that correspond to \textbf{the architecture of a graphic}
(aka plot).

The phrase ``grammar of graphics'' actually comes from the book by that
name written by statistician and computer scientist \textbf{Leland
Wilkinson} in 1999 and later revised:

\begin{figure}

{\centering 

\href{https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Grammar_of_Graphics/YGgUswEACAAJ?hl=en}{\includegraphics{notebooks/M12_RViz/images/paste-39DF579F.png}}

}

\caption{The Second Edition}

\end{figure}

It's worth reading if you want to get a solid grounding in
visualization, which belongs to the \textbf{design area of data
science}.

\hypertarget{a-layered-model}{%
\section{A Layered Model}\label{a-layered-model}}

Wilkinson takes an \textbf{object-oriented approach} to visualization
and formalizes two main \textbf{principles}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Roman{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Graphics} are built out of distinct \textbf{\emph{layers}} of
  grammatical \textbf{elements.}
\item
  In each layer, meaningful \textbf{plots} are constructed through
  \textbf{mappings of data onto aesthetics.}
\end{enumerate}

The essential grammatical elements to create any visualization are:

\includegraphics{notebooks/M12_RViz/images/paste-E167991C.png}

According to Wickham, who adopted these principles and applied them to
R,

\begin{quote}
A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to \textbf{concisely
describe the components of a graphic}. Such a grammar allows us to
\textbf{move beyond named graphics} (e.g., the ``scatterplot'') and gain
insight into \textbf{the deep structure} that underlies statistical
graphics
(\href{https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098}{Wickham
2012}).
\end{quote}

Wickham takes this idea and develops it into this:

\includegraphics{notebooks/M12_RViz/images/paste-D2214B2A.png}

\href{https://blog.gramener.com/grammar-of-graphics-data-stories/}{Source}
(see also
\href{https://www.science-craft.com/2014/07/08/introducing-the-grammar-of-graphics-plotting-concept/}{ScienceCraft}).

You can see that everything starts with \textbf{data.}

Then data are mapped on \textbf{aesthetics} within \textbf{geometries.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Geometries} are geometric things like points, lines, and bars.
\item
  \textbf{Aesthetics} are visual things like position, size, color and
  shape.
\end{itemize}

You can see how the latter are properties of the former.

Also note that aesthetics make use of visual channels to signify

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Size can means greater than, which is good for numeric scale but not
  categories
\item
  Color can signify things like value, e.g.~via
  \texttt{red\ :\ dangerous\ :\ :\ green\ :\ safe}.
\end{itemize}

These are the primary layers. The other layers apply \textbf{downstream
modifications} that add more \textbf{information} and \textbf{style} to
the graph.

\hypertarget{the-bare-minimum}{%
\section{The Bare Minimum}\label{the-bare-minimum}}

Everything starts with \texttt{ggplot()} which is part of the Tidyverse.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(tidyverse)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
-- Attaching packages --------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.3.2 --

\end{verbatim}

Here is a basic graph -- a scatterplot comparing two features in the
iris dataset. I've broken out the functions and arguments so you can see
how the grammar is implemented:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{iris }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}
  \AttributeTok{mapping =} \FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}
    \AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ Sepal.Length, }
    \AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ Sepal.Width)}
\NormalTok{  ) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{size=}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{color=}\NormalTok{Species))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{notebooks/M12_RViz/M12-01-GGPlot_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf}

}

\end{figure}

\texttt{ggplot()} starts by creating a \textbf{coordinate system} that
you can add \textbf{layers} to.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \textbf{coordinate system} can be changed after the graph is
  initiated.
\end{itemize}

These \textbf{layers} are created by \textbf{geometry functions.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For example, \texttt{geom\_point} creates a point-based visualization.
\item
  There are many \texttt{geom\_} functions, and they can be layered on
  top of each other:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{geom\_point()}
  \item
    \texttt{geom\_bar()}
  \item
    \texttt{geom\_histogram()}
  \item
    \texttt{geom\_boxplot()}
  \item
    etc.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Here we have a plot with two layers. The second layer is created by a
\textbf{stat} function, which is similar to geom, but applies a
statistical transformation to the data.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{iris }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}
  \AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ Sepal.Length, }
  \AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ Sepal.Width)) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{size=}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{color=}\NormalTok{Species)) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{stat\_smooth}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{method =}\NormalTok{ lm)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
`geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{notebooks/M12_RViz/M12-01-GGPlot_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-6-1.pdf}

}

\end{figure}

The core the process is that each layer \textbf{maps} \textbf{data} onto
what are called \textbf{aesthetics (\texttt{aes}).}

Aesthetics are \textbf{visual objects and properties} that can used to
represent numeric and categorical values

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  x and y positions (in a two-dimensional system)
\item
  Color
\item
  Size
\item
  Shape
\item
  Text
\end{itemize}

In addition to these elements, ggplot also provides \textbf{faceting},
which is the visual equivalent of grouping by. Just as with group by, a
data feature is used to divide the visualization into groups, each
taking the same form but showing a different subset of data.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

Anyway, the \textbf{general structure} of a ggplot statement is the
following:

\begin{verbatim}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(
     mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>),
     stat = <STAT>, 
     position = <POSITION>
  ) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION>
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{the-operator}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{The \texttt{+}
operator}{The + operator}}\label{the-operator}}

You will notice the use of the \texttt{+} operator to connect ggplot
functions together to produce a final product. Theses are not quite the
same as pipes \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%}.

The difference is that pipes feed data from one function to another,
whereas the \texttt{+} operation combines elements to produce an
increasingly developed visualization.

Another thing to keep in mind: the \texttt{+} always goes at the
\textbf{end of a line}, not at the beginning.

\hypertarget{introduction-8}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-8}}

R provides a notebook style coding environment similar to Jupyter.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It follows the \textbf{literate programming} paradigm of
  \textbf{inter-leaving text and code}.
\item
  It uses a version of \href{https://www.markdownguide.org/}{Markdown}
  to create the text components.
\item
  It allows executable \textbf{code blocks}.
\item
  They can be used interactively or as \textbf{exported} documents into
  standard formats.
\end{itemize}

How, the R approach differs in some important ways:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  RMarkdown is \textbf{not visually rendered} while your are editing.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The document has to be `knitted' to see this.
  \item
    Newer versions of RStudio have a visual mode that does render
    Markdown, and also allows you to edit in this mode.
  \item
    This differs from Jupyter's cell-by-cell approach.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  RMarkdown \textbf{allows several programming languages} to be run in
  the same notebook. - RMarkdown files are meant to be \emph{published
  documents}, not workspaces for coding.
\item
  RMarkdown is written in markdown and uses
  \href{https://yaml.org/}{YAML}to store configuration information.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Jupyter notebooks are written in \textbf{JavaScript}, which contains
    both configuration data and content data in the same structure.
  \item
    This difference is what accounts for the different editing
    experiences. JavaScript is the native programming language of web
    browsers; the notebook format is executable code that can be
    integrated into a web application.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{varieties-of-r-markdown-outputs}{%
\section{Varieties of R Markdown
outputs}\label{varieties-of-r-markdown-outputs}}

R Markdown is designed to be output to several formats:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{R Notebooks}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Designed to previewed
  \item
    Or output to \texttt{(html\textbar{}pdf\textbar{}doc)\_notebook}
  \item
    Have Preview in RStudio toolbar (but also Knit in menu)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Documents}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Output to \texttt{(html\textbar{}pdf\textbar{}doc)\_document}
  \item
    Has Knit in RStudio toolbar
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Presentations}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Produce slideshows from your source file, in ioslides, beamer, or
    powerpoint.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Shiny}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Create interactive apps that can be published on the web.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{knitting}{%
\section{Knitting}\label{knitting}}

Knitting is the process of compiling all the code and visual assets of
an RMarkdown into a single file.

\hypertarget{publishing}{%
\section{Publishing}\label{publishing}}

RMarkdown has publication in mind as an outcome. RStudio allows you to
publish in these destinations:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://rpubs.com/}{RPubs}
\item
  \href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/}{R Studio Connect}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{outputting}{%
\section{Outputting}\label{outputting}}

There are two ways to set the output of a document:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Permanently, by modifying the YAML header:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

  This is useful if you want to programmatically produce multiple types
  of output.
\end{enumerate}

RStudio's knit button renders a file to the first format listed in its
\texttt{output} field.

You can also do it by code:

\begin{verbatim}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/rmarkdown-knit.png")
\end{verbatim}

Each output format is associated with an R function.

You can either write \texttt{foo} or \texttt{pkg::foo}.

If you omit \texttt{pkg}, the default is assumed to be rmarkdown.

It's important to know the name of the function that makes the output
because that's where you get help.

For example, to figure out what parameters you can set with
\texttt{html\_document}, look at \texttt{?rmarkdown::html\_document}.

\hypertarget{output-options}{%
\subsection{Output options}\label{output-options}}

To override the default parameter values, you need to use an expanded
\texttt{output} field. For example, if you wanted to render an
\texttt{html\_document} with a floating table of contents, you'd use:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{output}\KeywordTok{:}
\AttributeTok{  }\FunctionTok{html\_document}\KeywordTok{:}
\AttributeTok{    }\FunctionTok{toc}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ }\CharTok{true}
\AttributeTok{    }\FunctionTok{toc\_float}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ }\CharTok{true}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can even render to multiple outputs by supplying a list of formats:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{output}\KeywordTok{:}
\AttributeTok{  }\FunctionTok{html\_document}\KeywordTok{:}
\AttributeTok{    }\FunctionTok{toc}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ }\CharTok{true}
\AttributeTok{    }\FunctionTok{toc\_float}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ }\CharTok{true}
\AttributeTok{  }\FunctionTok{pdf\_document}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ default}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note the special syntax if you don't want to override any of the default
options.

You also pass it a plot that was assigned to a variable.

\hypertarget{using-in-r}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Using \texttt{::} in
R}{Using :: in R}}\label{using-in-r}}

When you load libraries in R that have the same function names, R
resolves this by picking a default, and then letting you access the
others using \texttt{::} operator to specify the library from which the
method comes.

The rule is that the package loaded last will hide, or \textbf{mask},
the function from earlier packages.

If you want to have a certain function be the default, make sure you
load it last.

For example, when we load \texttt{tidyverse}, we get this message:

\begin{verbatim}
✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
\end{verbatim}

This means that \texttt{dplyr} overrides the \texttt{filter()} and
\texttt{lag()} methods associated with the \texttt{stats} library.

Similarly, when you load \texttt{plotly}, you'll see this:

\begin{verbatim}
Attaching package: ‘plotly’

The following object is masked from ‘package:ggplot2’:

    last_plot

The following object is masked from ‘package:stats’:

    filter

The following object is masked from ‘package:graphics’:

    layout
\end{verbatim}

One thing I have noticed is that even though the last library masks the
other functions, the help operator
\texttt{?\textless{}objectname\textgreater{}} does not follow this.

Also, in this script, note that \texttt{dplyr::filter} is the default,
even though \texttt{plotly::filter} loaded after dplyr. This is because
Plotly' filter function is not used in the normal way; it appears in the
context of the \texttt{transforms} argument to \texttt{plot\_ly()}. No
need to get into this now, but just know that that's why it does not
mask \texttt{dplyr}.

\textbf{Examples}

Here, we call filter by itself and it uses the one from \texttt{dplyr}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DocumentationTok{\#\#| vscode: \{languageId: r\}}
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(mpg, hwy }\SpecialCharTok{\textgreater{}} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

But if we ask for help, we'll get the original \texttt{stats} version.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DocumentationTok{\#\#| vscode: \{languageId: r\}}
\DocumentationTok{\#\# ?filter}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And if we ask for help about Plotly's version, we see this:

\DocumentationTok{\#\# ?plotly}

Notice that \texttt{aes()} is not a helper function (a function in the
argument space).

Also, R dots become \texttt{\_} in the argument names.

Note that we don't have to use the syntax above, which groups the
functions in a single expression with \texttt{(...)}.

We can do this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ggplot(mpg) }\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{ aes(x}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}class\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{ geom\_bar(size}\OperatorTok{=}\DecValTok{20}\NormalTok{)}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

For \textbf{faceting in Pandas}, see this:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29786227/how-do-i-plot-facet-plots-in-pandas

Notice that it is essentially the result of a \texttt{.groupby()}
followed by \texttt{.unstack()}.

So, Pandas expects you to do the data transformations upfront.

GGPlot2 will handle these in the geometries and facets

GGPlot2 is easier, but Pandas separates comcerns

\textbf{As a rule, data operations should never take place in the
visualization}.

\chapter{Project Management}\label{project-management}}

Some basic facts

Project management is an{~}established field{~}that is used for many
activities.

It is a profession in which you can be{~}certified{~}as a~ CPM.

It is a field with an established and large{~}body of knowledge{~}--
PMBOK.

Broadly speaking, it refers to{~}a class of rational methods and
protocols for organizing the labor of complex activities in order to
achieve specific outcomes on time and on budget.

Think{~}NASA's{~}space program in the 1960s.

Its history dates to the early 20th century but becomes highly developed
in the 1950s and 60s.

It is closely associated with{~}US military{~}operations, e.g.~Gantt
Charts and PERT.

It was later adapted to{~}software development, due to the complexity
and importances of of this kind of work.

\includegraphics{topics/../media/early-gantt-chart.png}

Source

Software is also{~}mission critical

From the beginning, it has been used to support{~}critical operations:
weapons systems, air traffic control, financial systems, health care,
etc.

Only recently are we seeing the effects of software design -- in the
form of data products -- fail on the basis of bias and other flaws that
lead to{~}social harm

In the 1960s, the US Department of Defenses study of software problems
found that:

47\% of software delivered could not be used, as it usually didn't meet
requirements

29\% of funded software was never delivered, as it was usually canceled
due to cost/schedule overruns

19\% of software was useful after extensive rework, and it usually cost
36 times more to fix problems after release

Because of this,{~}software engineering was developed.

But Software development is hard{~}for many reasons:

Hardware and software are inherently{~}complex.

Code is imperfect and{~}error-prone.

Code is always{~}an interpretation of specifications{~}that are
always{~}underspecified. → DEBUGGING THE SPEC

Underspecified{~}in two senses:

The inherent{~}inadequacy of language{~}to represent reality.

``The map is not the terrain''

The fact that{~}people don't know what they want{~}even when they say
they do.

That is, reality itself changes.

\includegraphics{topics/../media/pm-operation-success.jpg}

Source

Many{~}paradigms of the software development{~}life cycle{~}(SDLC) have
been introduced over the years to address these issues:

Waterfall

Spiral

Etc. → See{~}Tutorialspoint on SDLC.

The Waterfall Model

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{topics/../media/pm-waterfall.jpg}

}

\caption{Waterfall Methodology}

\end{figure}

\href{https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FJ4rlfMcDfc/V8mDTJfcDQI/AAAAAAAAA4s/f1dd7JC9-QsBh-67gdIDpq5ThubrTcVywCK4B/s1600/maxresdefault.jpg}{Source}

What they all have in is a{~}faith in the power of planning and
engineering{~}to achieve results:

Planning as the ability to{~}predict accurately how things will unfold

and have people understand and{~}follow rules.

Engineering as the{~}operationalization{~}of labor processes

The ability to treat{~}human behavior{~}as a{~}tractable variable.~

the logic of the machine applied to the the organization of labor.

These assumptions are reflected in the{~}relationship between client and
developer

Notice that absence of the client in the design, building, and
validation

This is partly the result of mitigating the{~}mission creep{~}introduced
by the client~

The Iron Triangle

\includegraphics{topics/../media/pm-iron-triangle.png}

The Spiral Method

The Spiral Method recognizes the need to be more iterative, and
introduces the client at points in an{~}ongoing cycle.~

The methods have the virtue of being{~}rational{~}and{~}comprehensive,
defining all the things involved in software development

But they are{~}very linear

Even the Spiral method, which is really a 2D linear process, where
phases are features and iterations are observations:

Primary sequence S = OI → AE → PD → NPP

ProcessP = S1{~}→ S2{~}→ S3{~}→ \ldots{} → SN

\hypertarget{main-content}{}
Agile development is essentially a{~}philosophy{~}developed in response
to{~}bureaucratic{~}software development processes.

It is an approach that focuses on the realities of software:

Individuals and interactions{~}over{~}processes and tools

Working software{~}over{~}comprehensive documentation

Customer collaboration{~}over{~}contract negotiation

Responding to change{~}over{~}following a plan

Essentially, it is based on a{~}mistrust{~}of machines, plans,
contracts, documents, etc.

The{~}Agile Manifesto~ was written in 2001 after a number of lighter and
more flexible approaches were developed in the 1990s

SCRUM

XP (Extreme Program)~

Etc.

It is also a collection of{~}methods and tools

User stories

Scrum meetings

Sprints

Task weighting with cards

Etc.

Agile is also{~}counter-cultural, like many of the software movements
that attended the rise of the web~~

Here are the 12 Principles of Agile SD:

Customer satisfaction by{~}early and continuous delivery{~}of valuable
software. → The ``early and often'' of open source development.

Welcome changing requirements, even in{~}late{~}development.

Deliver working software{~}frequently{~}(weeks rather than months)

Close,{~}daily{~}cooperation between business people and developers

Projects are built around{~}motivated individuals, who should
be{~}trusted

Face-to-face{~}conversation is the best form of communication
(co-location)

Working software{~}is the primary measure of progress

Sustainable{~}development, able to maintain a constant pace

Continuous{~}attention to technical excellence and good design

Simplicity---the art of maximizing the amount of work not done---is
essential

Best{~}architectures, requirements, and designs emerge
from{~}self-organizing{~}teams

Regularly,{~}the team reflects{~}on how to become more effective, and
adjusts accordingly

As you can see, it's all about{~}giving teams the freedom and trust{~}to
creatively respond to client needs and change.

As an aside, it's worth noting the effect of the Web on these
developments

Agile was spurred by the{~}affordances of the Web{~}and{~}open source
software

And for teams to{~}organize organically,~without the oversight of
governmental bodies or corporations

Influenced by the success of Open Source tools like{~}Linux

Consistent with{~}Git{~}as a tool for organically organizing software
development

\hypertarget{user-stories}{%
\chapter{User Stories}\label{user-stories}}

User Stories{~}are at the heart of Agile development.

Instead of eliciting requirements through a formal process, teams ask
clients to provide statements in verbal form:

As a {[}type of user{]},

I want {[}an action{]}

so that {[}a benefit/value{]}

These are written on{~}index cards.

These are accompanied by{~}conversation{~}to clarify the meaning of the
sentences.

These are then converted into{~}requirements:

Functional{~}-- relating specifically to how the software will work,
i.e.~function.

Non-functional{~}(so-called) -- relating to the broader purpose and
context of usage.

These map roughly onto the second and third parts of the user story.

They also map on MACHINE and HUMAN.

This{~}page{~}shows some examples of stories mapping onto features
(so-called acceptance criteria).

These requirements are then{~}prioritized

Using{~}MSCW{~}-- Must / Should / Can / Won't

Within the context of a{~}scope{~}definition in a{~}charter{~}(not
discussed here)

See{~}this link{~}for some guidance.

After this, requirements are serialized into a rough schedule, grouped
into{~}milestones.

In executing the ``plan,'' teams meet regularly in brief, stand-up
meetings called{~}scrums.

These happen daily

These involve the development team

Stakeholder representatives, such as the product manager, may attend too

At regular intervals,{~}clients{~}are introduced to the process

Prototypes, MVPs, etc. are presented

Feedback{~}is elicited early and often

The process is driven by a{~}communication{~}plan:

Frequency of meeting

Mode of communication -- F2F, Slack, Git

Task management tools -- Jira, Trello, Smartsheet, etc.

Other{~}artifacts{~}are involved in this process:

The project{~}charter

The project{~}plan

A{~}Kan Ban{~}board

But we will get into these later.
