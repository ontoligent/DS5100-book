## The Tidyverse

Tidyverse is a collection of essential R packages for data science.

The packages included in the Tidyverse are designed to support the pipeline of activities associated with data science, such as filtering, transforming, visualizing, etc.

Tidyverse was created by **Hadley Wickham** and his team with the aim of providing all these utilities to clean and work with data.

Here's a graphic of the packages associated with the Tidyverse:

## Dplyr

Dplyr introduces **new set of functions** that make working with data more intuitive.

-   It does this by introducing a set of functions that work together well to produce pipelines of actions.

But as important, it introduces a **vocabulary** for talking about data.

-   This makes it possible to imagine solutions verbally, and then to implement them in code.

To use the Tidyverse, we often import everything:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Piping with `%>%`

Just a quick note about this **odd looking** operator that you will start to see.

One of the key elements of the Tidyverse is the use of **piping**, or the ability of to pass the return values of one function to another, with without have to nest functions.

For example, instead of something like this:

```{r}
a <- "Hello"
b <- "World"

var1 <- c(a, b)
var2 <- paste(var1)
print(var2)
```

Or this:

```{r}
print(paste(c(a,b)))
```

We can do:

```{r}
c(a, b) %>%
  paste() %>%
  print()
```

Although the last pattern is longer than the preceding, it is much easier to read and write, especially when we are working with several connected functions.

This is similar to **method chaining** in Python, but is more pervasive.

-   In Python you can do it with individual objects that return themselves (as it were).
-   In Tidyverse, you can apply it to **any two methods** so long as it makes sense to pass the output of as the input of another.
-   Basically, the output of one function becomes the first argument of the following the `%>%`.

It is similar to the pipe operator `|` in Unix shells.

By the way, the operator comes with the [**magrittr**](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/) package, which is a central part of the Tidyverse. It is so central, in fact, that packages in the tidyverse load `%>%` automatically.

It provides a set of operators which make your code more readable.

# Tibbles

Dplyr can work with different rectangular data structures:

-   Plain old Dataframes
-   Tibbles
-   Data.tables (see [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html))

The foundational data structure of the Tidyverse is the **tibble**.

Tibbles are data frames, but they tweak some older behaviors to make your life a little easier.

To learn more about tibbles, check out the vignette:

```{r}
vignette("tibble")
```

## Creating tibbles

If you need to make a tibble "by hand", you can use `tibble()` or `tribble()` (see below).

`tibble()` works by assembling individual vectors, **column-wise** operation:

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 5)
y <- c("a", "b", "h")
tibble(x, y)
```

You can also optionally name the inputs, provide data inline with `c()`, and perform computation:

```{r}
tibble(
  x1 = x,
  x2 = c(10, 15, 25),
  y = sqrt(x1^2 + x2^2)
)
```

Every column in a data frame or tibble must be same length, so you'll get an error if the lengths are different:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#| error: true
tibble(
  x = c(1, 5),
  y = c("a", "b", "c")
)
```

As the error suggests, individual values will be recycled to the same length as everything else:

```{r}
tibble(
  x = 1:5,
  y = "a",
  z = TRUE
)
```

## Tribbles

Another way to create a tibble is with `tribble()`, which short for **transposed tibble**.

`tribble()` is customized for data entry in code: **column headings start with `~`** and **entries are separated by commas**.

This makes it possible to lay out small amounts of data in an easy to read form:

```{r}
tribble(
  ~x, ~y, ~z,
  "a", 2, 3.6,
  "b", 1, 8.5
)
```

Finally, if you have a regular `data frame` you can turn it into to a tibble with `as_tibble()`:

```{r}
as_tibble(mtcars)
```

The inverse of `as_tibble()` is `as.data.frame()`; it converts a tibble back into a regular `data.frame`.

## Non-syntactic names

It's possible for a tibble to have column names that are not valid R variable names, names that are **non-syntactic**.

For example, the variables might not start with a letter or they might contain unusual characters like a space.

To refer to these variables, you need to surround them with backticks, `` ` ``:

```{r}
tb <- tibble(
  `:)` = "smile", 
  ` ` = "space",
  `2000` = "number"
)
tb
```

You'll also need the backticks when working with these variables in other packages, like ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr.

# Tibbles vs. data.frame

There are two main differences in the usage of a tibble vs. a classic `data.frame`: **printing** and **subsetting**.

If these differences cause problems when working with older packages, you can turn a tibble back to a regular data frame with `as.data.frame()`.

## Printing

The print method:

-   Only the first 10 rows
-   All the columns that fit on screen

This makes it much easier to work with large data.

```{r}
tibble(
  a = lubridate::now() + runif(1e3) * 86400,
  b = lubridate::today() + runif(1e3) * 30,
  c = 1:1e3,
  d = runif(1e3),
  e = sample(letters, 1e3, replace = TRUE)
) %>% head()
```

Where possible, **tibbles also use color** to draw your eye to important differences.

One of the most important distinctions is between the string `"NA"` and the missing value, `NA`:

```{r}
tibble(x = c("NA", NA))
```

Tibbles are designed to avoid overwhelming your console when you print large data frames.

But **sometimes you need more output** than the default display.

There are a few options that can help.

First, you can explicitly `print()` the data frame and control the number of rows (`n`) and the `width` of the display. `width = Inf` will display all columns:

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
flights %>%
  print(n = 10, width = Inf)
```

You can also **control the default print behavior** by setting options:

-   `options(tibble.print_max = n, tibble.print_min = m)`: if more than `n` rows, print only `m` rows.
-   Use `options(tibble.print_min = Inf)` to always show all rows.
-   Use `options(tibble.width = Inf)` to always print all columns, regardless of the width of the screen.

You can see a complete list of options by looking at the package help with `package?tibble`.

## Using RStudio `View()`

A final option is to use RStudio's built-in data viewer to get a scrollable view of the complete dataset. This is also often useful at the end of a long chain of manipulations.

```{r}
#| eval: false
flights %>%
  View()
```

## Extracting variables

So far all the tools you've learned have worked with complete data frames.

If you want to pull out a single variable, you can use `dplyr::pull()`:

```{r}
tb <- tibble(
  id = LETTERS[1:5],
  x1  = 1:5,
  y1  = 6:10
)
```

```{r}
tb %>%  
  pull(x1) # by name
```

```{r}
tb %>%  
  pull(1)  # by position
```

`pull()` also takes an optional `name` argument that specifies the column to be used as names for a named vector, which you'll learn about in [Chapter -@sec-vectors].

```{r}
tb %>%  
  pull(x1, name = id)
```

You can also use the base R tools `$` and `[[`. `[[` can extract by name or position; `$` only extracts by name but is a little less typing.

Extract by name:

```{r}
tb$x1
tb[["x1"]]
```

Extract by position:

```{r}
tb[[1]]
```

Compared to a `data frame`, **tibbles are more strict**: they never do partial matching, and they will generate a warning if the column you are trying to access does not exist.

```{r}
# Tibbles complain a lot:
tb$x
tb$z
```

```{r}
# Data frame use partial matching and don't complain if a column doesn't exist
df <- as.data.frame(tb)
df$x
df$z
```

For this reason we sometimes joke that **tibbles are lazy and surly**: they do less and complain more.

## Subsetting

Lastly, there are some important differences when using `[`.

With `data.frame`s, `[` sometimes returns a `data.frame`, and sometimes returns a vector.

-   This is a common source of bugs.

With tibbles, **`[` always returns another tibble**.

-   This can sometimes cause problems when working with older code.
-   If you hit one of those functions, just use `as.data.frame()` to turn your tibble back to a `data.frame`.
